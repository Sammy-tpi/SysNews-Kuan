**NewsRender** is a Python-powered pipeline that delivers a **daily bilingual (English + Traditional Chinese)** digest of the most relevant AI, FinTech, and Startup news. It pulls content from curated **RSS/RSSHub feeds** and the **EventRegistry API**, filters it using custom keywords, ranks and summarizes with **LLM models**, and sends out a clean, branded HTML email to subscribed recipients.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the full pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

This executes the following steps:

1. `fetch_newsapi_ai.py` — Query EventRegistry for AI/FinTech articles.
2. `fetch_rss_articles.py` — Async fetch from RSS/RSSHub sources using `config/sources.json`.
3. `filter_articles_by_date.py` — Keep articles published in the last two days.
4. `filter_relevance_gpt.py` — Use GPT to decide if an article should be kept and assign a 0–10 relevance score.
5. `classify_articles_gpt.py` — Categorize and tag the region.
6. `select_top_articles.py` — Pick top article per category and region.
7. `summarize_articles.py` — Generate Traditional Chinese summaries.
8. `validate_news_data.py` — Validate format and remove duplicates.
9. `generate_digest.py` — Render `digest.html` using a clean Jinja2 template.
10. `send_digest.py` — Email the digest via Gmail SMTP.

Intermediate results are stored in the `data/` folder.

## 🛠 Customization

### Modify Sources

Edit `config/sources.json` to update or add RSS feeds:

```json
{
  "name": "TechCrunch",
  "region": "Global",
  "topics": ["AI", "FinTech"],
  "source_type": "rss",
  "full_text": true
}
```

### Update Keywords

Edit `config/keywords.json` to define keyword filters in multiple languages (EN/ZH):

```json
{
  "keywords": ["AI", "演算法交易", "智能合約", "Robo-advisor", "金融科技"]
}
```

## 🖼 Sample Output

The output is a responsive, visually clean **HTML digest** with 6 cards:

* 3 regions: 🌍 Global, 🇹🇼 East Asia
* 3 categories: Research, Infrastructure, Startup, and FinTech

Each card includes:

* ✅ Article title
* ✅ Source & time
* ✅ English summary (LLM-generated)
* ✅ Traditional Chinese summary (translated)

## ⏱️ Automation

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `main.py` daily:

```
.github/workflows/daily.yml
```

You can enable it by committing a valid `.env` (excluded from Git) on your deployment server or GitHub Secrets.
