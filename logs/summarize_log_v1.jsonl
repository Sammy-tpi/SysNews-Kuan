The platform does not provide exposure to cryptocurrencies but instead focuses on government-backed renewable energy initiatives.\nProjective’s infrastructure is built on Avalanche, a layer-1 blockchain developed by Ava Labs, designed for scalability and interoperability.\nAccredited investors can participate in Injective’s lending pool using the USDC (USDC) stablecoin.\nThe State of Illinois will act as the guarantor for Projective’s lending pool, with all participating projects rated byMoody’s credit rating agency, the company said.\nRelated:$250M Ondo Catalyst fund signals ‘arms race’ for RWA tokenization\nThe US solar market has grown substantially in recent years, surpassing 160 gigawatts of installed capacity as of 2024, according to theWorld Resources Institute. Solar energy now accounts for an estimated 5% to 6% of the nation’s total electricity supply, nearly double its share in 2020.\nSolar projects are also gaining momentum at the municipal level, particularly in school districts. By 2024, an estimated one in nine K–12 students would attend a school powered by solar energy, according to 2022Generation180report.\nHowever, “thousands of shovel-ready projects [are] sitting idle because traditional financing can’t serve this market efficiently,” said Projective Finance co-founder Atticus Francken, who described solar projects as facing a “massive financing bottleneck.”\nTokenization is widely seen as a way to transform solar financing by making it more accessible, efficient and transparent.\nIn 2022, BNP Paribasnotedthat tokenization could help catalyze renewable energy and ESG-focused investing by providing “more transparent investment opportunities” and giving smaller projects a much broader reach.\nProjective isn’t the only platform exploring tokenized green energy investments. AsCointelegraph reported, the Italian green energy company Enel Group has partnered with a crypto wallet provider to enable fractional ownership of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain. The tokenized product allows residents to benefit from solar energy without physical installation.\nRelated:SEC ends ‘regulation through enforcement,’ calls tokenization 'innovation'\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "Projective Finance於Avalanche區塊鏈上推出700萬美元的貸款池，為伊利諾州公立學校的太陽能項目提供融資。此貸款池專注於永續發展，讓去中心化金融(DeFi)投資者直接參與美國政府支持的可再生能源基礎設施項目。所有項目均由穆迪評級，並由伊利諾州政府擔保，以USDC穩定幣進行投資。此舉旨在解決太陽能項目融資瓶頸，透過區塊鏈技術提升效率與透明度。  此平台不直接接觸加密貨幣，而是聚焦於政府背書的可再生能源項目。\n", "summary": "Projective Finance於Avalanche區塊鏈上推出700萬美元的貸款池，為伊利諾州公立學校的太陽能項目提供融資。此貸款池專注於永續發展，讓去中心化金融(DeFi)投資者直接參與美國政府支持的可再生能源基礎設施項目。所有項目均由穆迪評級，並由伊利諾州政府擔保，以USDC穩定幣進行投資。此舉旨在解決太陽能項目融資瓶頸，透過區塊鏈技術提升效率與透明度。  此平台不直接接觸加密貨幣，而是聚焦於政府背書的可再生能源項目。"}

The new capital accelerates Levelpath’s mission to reinvent how global enterprises manage procurement, typically the second-largest operational expense after payroll.\nOther investors participated in the funding round as well, including Redpoint Ventures, Benchmark, 01A, New View Capital and World Innovation Lab. As part of the funding, Battery Ventures General Partner Neeraj Agrawal will join Levelpath’s board of directors alongside representatives from existing investors.\nAgrawal, who has made multiple appearances on the Forbes Midas List and coined the “T2D3” growth paradigm for SaaS businesses, previously led Battery’s investment in Coupa, a leading spend management platform that went public in 2016 and was acquired for approximately $8 billion in 2023.\n“Levelpath represents the future of enterprise procurement: intelligent, automated, and strategically aligned with business objectives,” said Agrawal. “The team has built remarkable technology that delivers demonstrable value to some of the world’s largest companies. We are excited to partner with them as they scale to become the definitive procurement platform for global enterprises.”\nSolving the $13 Trillion Procurement Challenge\nProcurement is the second-largest business expense after payroll, yet it remains one of the least modernized functions in the enterprise. With Levelpath’s proprietary Hyperbridge reasoning engine at its core, the platform delivers intelligent automation through true AI-native design, unlocking capabilities that legacy solutions built before 2022 are architecturally challenged to efficiently support.\nFor decades, procurement has been trapped by systems designed for yesterday’s problems. Complex interfaces. Endless workflows. Frustrated users. Levelpath changes everything with the first truly AI-native procurement platform built from the ground up for the modern enterprise.\n“Procurement touches every part of a business, yet it’s been held back by tools that fight against you instead of working with you,” said Alex Yakubovich, Co-founder and CEO of Levelpath. “We didn’t retrofit old systems with AI. We reimagined what procurement could be when intelligence is built into every interaction.”\nSince launching its flagship platform after raising $44.5 million across Benchmark-led Seed and Redpoint-led Series A rounds, Levelpath has built momentum as the “next chapter” of procurement modernization, offering a sleek, AI‑native experience that delivers speed, transparency and ROI at scale.\nFueling Rapid Growth and Market Expansion\nWith Levelpath’s AI Agents, procurement teams do not just keep up with the AI wave, they lead it.\nLevelpath’s AI Agents are ushering in a new era of intelligent procurement with autonomous, strategic AI capabilities embedded directly into the platform.

These AI Agents do not simply support rigid and fragile task automation; they deliver smarter workflows, faster deployment, and predictable outcomes from day one. With preconfigured agents available out of the box, teams can immediately benefit from enhanced decision-making and operational efficiency without the need for complex IT support.\nPowered by Hyperbridge, Levelpath’s AI-native architecture, these AI Agents unify model grounding, context management, and orchestration while ensuring secure, compliant data handling. By identifying the relevant business context, routing queries to the most suitable large language models, and tailoring outputs to specific organizational needs, Levelpath empowers procurement teams to achieve greater efficiency and impact, with fewer resources. This foundation enables organizations to benefit from rapid AI innovation without the need for constant due diligence on the models or integrations themselves.\nWith the launch of Levelpath’s AI Agents, the company is doubling down on its core mission: to modernize one of the most critical and overlooked business functions with technology that is both intelligent and delightful. As enterprises face mounting pressure to streamline procurement AI-native tools like Levelpath Agents are poised to become essential infrastructure.\nLevelpath will use the new funding to accelerate product development, scale its go-to-market team and deepen ecosystem partnerships, all in service of meeting growing enterprise demand for AI-native procurement. With strong early traction and strategic integrations like its placement in Coupa’s App Marketplace, Levelpath is well-positioned to make delightful, intelligent procurement the new enterprise standard.\n“AI is transforming how enterprises operate, and procurement is no exception,” said Stan Garber, Co-founder and President of Levelpath. “We’re not just building procurement tools, we’re building the intelligent infrastructure that turns procurement into a competitive edge that will radically accelerate productivity at scale.”\nLevelpath is now offering a monthly AI Masterclass webinar series to help leaders scale their impact, streamline operations, and accelerate their careers.

Make sure the summary is useful and meaningful for internal teams, focusing on the most relevant information.\n\n\nInput:\nTitle: WeLab Bank: taking digital banking to the next level in Hong Kong\nArticle Content: It didn’t take long for WeLab Bank to make its mark on Hong Kong’s digital banking landscape. Already by early 2025, within five years of its launch, it managed to outshine its peers by achieving its first breakeven – something that typically takes industry players five to seven years.\nThis followed a milestone 2024 for the bank. Its net revenue reached around HK$750 million (US$95 million) based on year-on-year (YoY) growth of over 30%. During the same time, its unsecured retail loan portfolio hit HK$5.5 billion (US$700 million), and its net interest margin reached 9.4%, expanding by 0.6% compared with the previous year. The bank also carved out a 11% market share in new unsecured personal loans, a leading position in Hong Kong.\nLee believes a combination of resilience, disciplined execution, strong risk management and innovation in the business model are the success factors setting WeLab Bank apart.\n“Our robust loan portfolio, distinct product structures and credit risk technology have enabled us to weather economic uncertainties while building a sustainable path to profitability,” he explained, while also pointing to quality customers, optimised deposit pricing using dynamic models and an expanding lending book among key drivers.\nAs a result, the bank’s financial foundations remain robust. Its total deposits grew 120% YoY and it maintained a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 80%.\nDiversified revenue streams have also played a big role in the recent growth story. Notably, Lee highlights demand for wealth management products as customers shift away from time deposits in today’s environment of falling interest rates.\nMaking credit decisions count\nCentral to WeLab Bank’s accelerated journey has been advanced technology, precision pricing and disciplined balance sheet management – foundations of a sustained capital generation model that stem from a proprietary AI-driven credit decision engine.\nThis reflects the importance of sophisticated risk technology within digital banking. “This is the cornerstone of our performance and differentiation,” said Lee. “By integrating both traditional and alternative data, the engine assesses not only a customer’s repayment ability but also their willingness to repay. This enables us to approve the ‘right customers’ while maintaining credit quality, even in a challenging market environment.”\nThe results speak for themselves. Despite market delinquency worsening 13% YoY, WeLab Bank achieved a 37% improvement in credit performance in 2024.\n“This data-driven, technology-first approach ensures we remain agile, profitable and customer-focused, solidifying our position as the leader in Hong Kong’s digital banking landscape,” Lee added.\nDiversifying beyond lending\nData-led insights into customers have also proved to be a competitive advantage for WeLab Bank by enabling it to identify – and then penetrate – a significant segment of individuals in Hong Kong that remain underserved due to high entry barriers for financial advisory or overly complex banking requirements.\nIn line with this strategic shift beyond initial core lending products, wealth management was a key growth driver in 2024, with total assets under management boosting nearly 300% YoY.\nDriven by its commitment to accessibility and innovation, WeLab Bank’s GoWealth Digital Wealth Advisory platform helped to democratise investments by offering investment advisory services starting from just HK$100 (US$10), based on customers' goals rather than traditional risk-based factors.\nIt has been popular. Fee income for the bank from wealth management grew by over 70% YoY, fueled by strong demand for ‘first-in-market’ monthly fee Featured Fund Services, offering zero transaction fees and no investment caps.\nLeveraging AI for sustainable growth\nIn showcasing its ability to diversify and pursue innovative routes to growth, WeLab Bank’s ambition is to become an ‘AI first’ digital bank.\nThis will involve the exploration of integrating AI across its operations and customer journey – starting with building on its position as one of the first banks in Asia to deploy DeepSeek locally to enhance operational efficiency and upskill talents.\nTo achieve its AI vision, WeLab Bank plans to harness the transformative potential of AI Agents. “These AI Agents are designed to deliver hyper-personalised financial solutions, such as tailored investment products and loan offerings, transforming the bank from a reactive service provider to a proactive partner in its customers’ financial journeys,” explained Lee.\nFostering this type of culture and delivering high-impact AI applications will further reinforce the focus on customer experience, operational efficiency and risk management. “At the core of our approach are scalability, adaptability and ethical compliance, ensuring AI solutions deliver sustainable value while maintaining trust and accountability,” Lee added.\nYet WeLab Bank’s philosophy emphasises synergy between AI and human expertise. Instead, leveraging AI will set new industry benchmarks for innovation, efficiency and financial inclusion.\n“By reinvesting resources in AI innovation, WeLab Bank will foster a sustainable cycle of innovation that will keep us at the forefront of the industry, generating greater value for customers and shareholders,” said Lee.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "香港WeLab Bank於2024年營收達7.5億港元，較去年增長逾三成，並於五年內達成收支平衡。其無抵押零售貸款組合達55億港元，市佔率達11%，淨利息率達9.4%。WeLab Bank運用AI驅動的信用評估引擎 (AI-driven credit decision engine) 提升貸款審批效率及降低違約率，並透過GoWealth平台拓展財富管理業務，資產管理規模同比增長近300%。該行計劃進一步利用AI技術提升營運效率及個人化金融服務。\n", "summary": "香港WeLab Bank於2024年營收達7.5億港元，較去年增長逾三成，並於五年內達成收支平衡。其無抵押零售貸款組合達55億港元，市佔率達11%，淨利息率達9.4%。WeLab Bank運用AI驅動的信用評估引擎 (AI-driven credit decision engine) 提升貸款審批效率及降低違約率，並透過GoWealth平台拓展財富管理業務，資產管理規模同比增長近300%。該行計劃進一步利用AI技術提升營運效率及個人化金融服務。"}

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\nToday in crypto, the US has sanctioned a North Korea IT worker ring that was targeting US companies, a Japanese CEO will take his salary in Bitcoin as the firm adopts a BTC treasury strategy, and Metaplanet plans to use its Bitcoin reserves to buy cash-generating businesses.\nThe US Treasury on Tuesday sanctioned two people, a North Korean and Russian man, along with four entities involved in what it says was a North Korea-run IT worker ring that infiltrates US crypto companies aiming to exploit them.\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) slapped sanctions on the North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for allegedly stealing US citizens’ information to use as aliases and giving the information to hired foreign IT workers who would seek employment at US companies.\nOFAC also sanctioned the Russian national Gayk Asatryan for allegedly using his four Russia-based companies to employ dozens of North Korean IT workers. OFAC said North Korea aims to bankroll its missile programs by deploying a thousands-strong workforce of highly skilled IT workers all over the world.\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender.\nNorth Korea has been notorious for its high-profile hacks such as the $1.5 billion exploit against crypto exchange Bybit exploit in February, but TRM Labs said the nation is starting to shift to “deception-based revenue generation, including IT worker infiltration.”\nTakashi Tashiro, the new CEO of Tokyo-based energy company Remixpoint,will be paid in Bitcoinas part of stated efforts to be “in the same boat” as shareholders, the company said in astatementon Tuesday.\nRemixpoint said it will calculate Tashiro's salary and taxes, purchase the equivalent amount in Bitcoin (BTC) and transfer it to a wallet the CEO designates. The move is as part of a “shareholder-oriented management,” the company said.\n“The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation,” a translated version of the statement reads.\n”On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.”\nTashiro took over as CEO in June,sayingthat Remixpoint would place BTC “at the core of [its] financial strategy” as part of a shift to make the company focused on treasury management.\nJapanese firm Metaplanetplans to eventually use its Bitcoin reservesto acquire cash-generating businesses, possibly including a digital bank in Japan.\nIn a recentinterviewwith the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich said the company is racing to accumulate as much Bitcoin (BTC) as possible before turning its holdings into leverage for expansion.\n“We think of it as a Bitcoin gold rush,” Gerovich said. “We need to accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can... to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up.”\nThe Tokyo-listed firm, originally a hotel operator, started accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in 2024. It currently holds 15,555 BTC and aims to boost that figure to over 210,000 by 2027, 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist.\nPhase two of Metaplanet’s plan involves using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing, similar to securities or government bonds. “We’ll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses,” Gerovich said.\nGerovich said Metaplanet’s future acquisitions would ideally align with its strategy, so “maybe it is acquiring a digital bank in Japan and providing digital banking services that are superior to the services that retail now is getting.”\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "美國財政部制裁北韓與俄羅斯人士及相關實體，因其涉嫌透過駭客攻擊竊取美國加密貨幣公司資訊(crypto companies)。日本能源公司Remixpoint執行長將以比特幣(Bitcoin, BTC)領薪，公司亦採行BTC策略。Metaplanet公司計劃利用其比特幣儲備(Bitcoin reserves)收購獲利企業，例如日本數位銀行。  北韓藉此資助其飛彈計畫。此舉展現加密貨幣在企業財務策略中的應用。\n", "summary": "美國財政部制裁北韓與俄羅斯人士及相關實體，因其涉嫌透過駭客攻擊竊取美國加密貨幣公司資訊(crypto companies)。日本能源公司Remixpoint執行長將以比特幣(Bitcoin, BTC)領薪，公司亦採行BTC策略。Metaplanet公司計劃利用其比特幣儲備(Bitcoin reserves)收購獲利企業，例如日本數位銀行。  北韓藉此資助其飛彈計畫。此舉展現加密貨幣在企業財務策略中的應用。"}

In other words, the GOB token allocation is set aside for the current NFT holder, not the wallet address that held it during an arbitrary snapshot date.\nAdditionally, instead of granting a fully vested allotment of tokens to NFT holders, GOB will vest every second over the course of 24 months, with claims available weekly. (Company and team members have a 30-month vest, with a six-month cliff.)\nAnd that allotment is not designed to be an immediate exit point for holders, as Goblintown aims to launch small—or with a low market cap and tight circulating supply—as opposed to other token launches which may seek to launch with higher market caps and token supplies, offering their communities a strong day one stimulus and exit point.\nLaunch mechanics for other recent meme coins have created “misaligned incentives” between the community and the project, according to Taub, who said that they can seem to be designed “to be done day one.”\n“If I’m holding it, I’m sort of a sucker,” said Taub of launches that pair high valuations with a fully vested allocation on day one. \"We're trying to take the reverse approach.”\nBeyond the token allocations, Taub indicated that Goblintown will be doing its best to deal with snipers, a problem that has plagued Solana meme coins, allowing individuals or bots to snag a coin and create lots of sell pressure shortly after launch.\nTo do so, GOB launched in stealth without a pre-announcement, and directly via the Goblintown community to start. That—coupled with the small percentage of tokens available on day one—isn’t a perfect solution, but “should get us most of the way there,” the project’s GOB Green Paper reads.\nLast but not least, the project will address what it calls the “silent killer”—poor liquidity management—by implementing a 2.5% token tax designed to replenish the liquidity pool, help with operations and marketing, and create a deflationary flywheel with buybacks and burns. In other words, with every transaction a small tax or “fee” will be redirected to the team to support the future of the token.\n“We realized the solution is just a smart and balanced token tax that just gets reinvested back into the token,” Taub said, highlighting the innovation and early success of other token tax examples like that of Safemoon—“before all the crime,”he joked.\nIndividually, each component of the GOB token design has been implemented before elsewhere. But Taub and team think this combination will help sustain their token.\n“People have done vesting before, people have done token taxes before, they’ve done things to try and elbow out snipers,” he said. “They just haven’t ever been all put together, specifically for a meme coin for an NFT project.”\n“We think the market is sort of dying for and hungry for a new token design,” Taub continued. “That’s not a guarantee that it’s going to work, but if you can figure out a better design than what people are currently doing and get the demand, it could work.”\nGoblintown burst onto the scene in 2022 following a plunge in NFT demand, turning a free mint on Ethereum with no utility, roadmap, or Discord into apricey collection with a rabid, urine-obsessed community, using funmarketing gimmicks and the absurdityof the collection to spread the brand. It has sinceexpanded into gaming, as well.\nIt’ll use some of those tactics once more, launching with aTikTok filter called “Sell the Top”to promote the brand, and Telescram, a real hotline encouraging callers to leave detailed messages with love or hate for the token.\n“We just think this at least has potential,” said Taub. “It could die because nobody cares about it; it’s an attention game. But at least we're giving it a punter’s chance.”\nYour gateway into the world of Web3\nThe latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.\n© A next-generation media company.2025Decrypt Media, Inc.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "Goblintown NFT 項目於 2025 年 7 月 9 日推出 Solana 區塊鏈上的新型迷因幣 (meme coin) GOB。此幣種設計旨在解決迷因幣的壽命問題，其方法包括：24 個月線性解鎖 (vesting) 的代幣分配、避免高市值發行、反制狙擊者 (sniper) 以及 2.5% 的代幣稅用於補充流動性。此舉結合了先前迷因幣設計中曾出現但未整合的策略，期望創造更健康和永續的迷因幣生態。Goblintown 也將使用 TikTok 濾鏡和電話熱線等行銷手段推廣 GOB。\n", "summary": "Goblintown NFT 項目於 2025 年 7 月 9 日推出 Solana 區塊鏈上的新型迷因幣 (meme coin) GOB。此幣種設計旨在解決迷因幣的壽命問題，其方法包括：24 個月線性解鎖 (vesting) 的代幣分配、避免高市值發行、反制狙擊者 (sniper) 以及 2.5% 的代幣稅用於補充流動性。此舉結合了先前迷因幣設計中曾出現但未整合的策略，期望創造更健康和永續的迷因幣生態。Goblintown 也將使用 TikTok 濾鏡和電話熱線等行銷手段推廣 GOB。"}

Kick turn, which TechCrunch tested during a press drive in June, allows a vehicle traveling under 20 mph on dirt to kick out its back end and swing it to the right or left without moving the steering wheel. The idea is to give off-roaders the ability to make tight turns on trails by pushing a button and without going through the tedious task of a three-point turn.\nRivian fans and followers might recall a promoted, but never released, feature called “tank turn.” Kick turn, which controls power and tire grip, is the real-world and toned down version of tank turn. Rivian told TechCrunch that tank turn was never released because its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and others worried that tank turn would ruin trails. Not the best look for a company that has made outdoor activities and preserving the environment a big part of its brand.\nKick turn could still be abused if the driver stayed in the same spot and continued to spin the vehicle in a circle. However, Rivian has placed some software-powered guardrails on the feature, including limiting the speed and only allowing it to spin only in dirt.\nRivian first revealed its second-generation quad-motor configuration during a May 2024 press drive in Washington, in a bid to showcase theoverhaul of its flagship R1 line. That reboot touched every inch of its insides from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, interior seats, sensor stack, and software user interface.\nThe effort, which has led the company to build more of its major components in-house, is aimed at reducing the cost of manufacturing and improving the performance and appeal of its EVs.\nDeliveries of the new dual-motor and performance dual-motor trims began almost immediately, with the tri-motor configuration following by August 2024. The quad-motor, which is its most expensive and powerful trim, took another year to develop and refine the software features and embedded systems, and how they worked alongside the motors, suspension, and thermal management, according to the company.\nAnd the stakes are high that Rivian gets the quad-motor right. Rivian’s highly anticipated and cheaper R2 vehicles aren’t expected to go into production until the first half of 2026. Rivian is hoping the new quad-motor, which starts between $125,990 and $115,990 depending on the vehicle trim, will give sales a boost. And the software is a critical piece of its bid.\nIf the four motors (one located at each wheel) are the heart of the second-generation quad-motor, the software is the brain making it all work together.\nBensaid pointed to the development of advanced torque vectoring and balancing algorithms that have been introduced in the second-generation quad-motor.\n“Think about it as super complex mathematical processing behind the scenes to allow real-time usage and decisions based on information from the four wheels and then the four motors, while obviously keeping safety guards in place,” he said.\nWhat this means in practice is numerous sensors on the quad-motor R1S SUV and R1T truck provide information on yaw rate, steering angles, and other inputs, which are then fed into software models to control torque. In other words, Rivian’s in-house hardware and software work together in real time to distribute power at each wheel electronically.\nThat has allowed the EV maker to introduce kick turn as well as other software-meets-hardware features to the quad-motor, including its “RAD Tuner,” which lets users change the vehicle’s driving dynamics via the central touchscreen. The RAD Tuner was developed by a team of engineers, software developers, and designers nicknamed the “Rivian Adventure Department.”\nThe origin story began several years ago, according to Bensaid.\n“Every time we would go and test and qualify version of the software or the car, we have an engineering screen which is hidden with the secret code,” he said. It was here that early Rivian employee and R2 chief engineer Max Koff and R1 chief engineer Luke Lynch would configure the car as they wished — an exercise that often pushed the vehicles to new limits. “And that evolved into this idea of making this tuner available to customers.”\nWith RAD Tuner, drivers can create their own customized driving mode from scratch or build upon presets like “Rally” or “Sport.”\n“We really give users full control through software so that they can figure their unique personality of the car,” Bensaid said, adding this particular feature is really meant for expert drivers.\nBensaid emphasized this is more than a simple change to the user interface that lets drivers tinker around with balance, stability, and ride height.\n“I think what’s really important is the technology behind it,” he said. “For example, this torque balance, the fact that we’re able to configure this with a very simple slider — this is years of engineering development to have a very sophisticated torque vectoring algorithm with really a high-precision control that allows us to change values while we’re driving. It’s technically extremely, extremely difficult to do this type of changes.”\nThe company is also rolling out a launch cam feature, which uses an exterior camera recording to automatically capture “Launch Mode,” which that can catapult the new R1T quad-motor from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in less than 2.5 heart-pumping seconds. Users can replay the videos and view real-time stats like speed and distance overlays calculated by in-house controls software. Users can also export videos to a mobile device via USB port to save and share.\nThe 2026 R1T and R1S vehicles, including the quad-motor, also come built in with the North American Charging Standard, which was originally developed and popularized by Tesla.\nThis gives owners of the 2026 models access to Tesla’s vast network of fast chargers, known as Superchargers. Rivian is also supplying quad-motor customers with a complimentary CCS DC adapter, which was the long-standing EV charging standard until recently, allowing them to plug into other networks.\nAs part of this hardware upgrade, the company has also updated its software, specifically the EV charging trip planner feature. Now when a customer opens the trip planner and selects an NACS station, the information is updated in the trip planner to reflect that they don’t need an adapter.\nTopics\nTransportation Editor\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

OFAC said North Korea aims to bankroll its missile programs by deploying a thousands-strong workforce of highly skilled IT workers all over the world.\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender.\nNorth Korea has been notorious for its high-profile hacks such as the $1.5 billion exploit against crypto exchange Bybit exploit in February, but TRM Labs said the nation is starting to shift to “deception-based revenue generation, including IT worker infiltration.”\nTakashi Tashiro, the new CEO of Tokyo-based energy company Remixpoint,will be paid in Bitcoinas part of stated efforts to be “in the same boat” as shareholders, the company said in astatementon Tuesday.\nRemixpoint said it will calculate Tashiro's salary and taxes, purchase the equivalent amount in Bitcoin (BTC) and transfer it to a wallet the CEO designates. The move is as part of a “shareholder-oriented management,” the company said.\n“The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation,” a translated version of the statement reads.\n”On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.”\nTashiro took over as CEO in June,sayingthat Remixpoint would place BTC “at the core of [its] financial strategy” as part of a shift to make the company focused on treasury management.\nJapanese firm Metaplanetplans to eventually use its Bitcoin reservesto acquire cash-generating businesses, possibly including a digital bank in Japan.\nIn a recentinterviewwith the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich said the company is racing to accumulate as much Bitcoin (BTC) as possible before turning its holdings into leverage for expansion.\n“We think of it as a Bitcoin gold rush,” Gerovich said. “We need to accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can... to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up.”\nThe Tokyo-listed firm, originally a hotel operator, started accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in 2024. It currently holds 15,555 BTC and aims to boost that figure to over 210,000 by 2027, 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist.\nPhase two of Metaplanet’s plan involves using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing, similar to securities or government bonds. “We’ll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses,” Gerovich said.\nGerovich said Metaplanet’s future acquisitions would ideally align with its strategy, so “maybe it is acquiring a digital bank in Japan and providing digital banking services that are superior to the services that retail now is getting.”\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導、針對美國加密貨幣公司的駭客集團(IT worker ring)，該集團利用竊取的美國公民資料僱用外國IT人員滲透美國公司。日本能源公司Remixpoint執行長將以比特幣(Bitcoin)領薪，公司也將比特幣納入財務策略。日本公司Metaplanet則計畫利用其比特幣儲備(Bitcoin reserves)收購現金流充裕的企業，例如日本數位銀行。這些事件反映了地緣政治風險、企業採用比特幣(Bitcoin)的策略以及加密貨幣在商業應用上的新發展。\n", "summary": "美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導、針對美國加密貨幣公司的駭客集團(IT worker ring)，該集團利用竊取的美國公民資料僱用外國IT人員滲透美國公司。日本能源公司Remixpoint執行長將以比特幣(Bitcoin)領薪，公司也將比特幣納入財務策略。日本公司Metaplanet則計畫利用其比特幣儲備(Bitcoin reserves)收購現金流充裕的企業，例如日本數位銀行。這些事件反映了地緣政治風險、企業採用比特幣(Bitcoin)的策略以及加密貨幣在商業應用上的新發展。"}

Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders.Subscribe Now\nHugging Face, the $4.5 billion artificial intelligence platform that has become the GitHub of machine learning, announced Tuesday the launch ofReachy Mini, a $299 desktop robot designed to bring AI-powered robotics to millions of developers worldwide. The 11-inch humanoid companion represents the company’s boldest move yet to democratize robotics development and challenge the industry’s traditional closed-source, high-cost model.\nThe announcement comes as Hugging Face crosses a significant milestone of 10 million AI builders using its platform, with CEO Clément Delangue revealing in an exclusive interview that “more and more of them are building in relation to robotics.” The compact robot, which can sit on any desk next to a laptop, addresses what Delangue calls a fundamental barrier in robotics development: accessibility.\n“One of the challenges with robotics is that you know you can’t just build on your laptop. You need to have some sort of robotics partner to help in your building, and most people won’t be able to buy $70,000 robots,” Delangue explained, referring to traditional industrial robotics systems and even newer humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus, which is expected to cost $20,000-$30,000.\nReachy Miniemerges from Hugging Face’s April acquisition of French robotics StartupPollen Robotics, marking the company’s most significant hardware expansion since its founding. The robot represents the first consumer product to integrate natively with theHugging Face Hub, allowing developers to access thousands of pre-built AI models and share robotics applications through the platform’s “Spaces” feature.\nThe timing appears deliberate as the AI industry grapples with the next frontier: physical AI. While large language models have dominated the past two years, industry leaders increasingly believe that artificial intelligence will need physical embodiment to achieve human-level capabilities.Goldman Sachsprojects the humanoid robotics market could reach $38 billion by 2035, while theWorld Economic Forumidentifies robotics as a critical frontier technology for industrial operations.\n“We’re seeing more and more people moving to robotics, which is extremely exciting,” Delangue said. “The idea is to really become the desktop, open-source robot for AI builders.”\nReachy Minipacks sophisticated capabilities into its compact form factor. The robot features six degrees of freedom in its moving head, full body rotation, animated antennas, a wide-angle camera, multiple microphones, and a 5-watt speaker. The wireless version includes aRaspberry Pi 5computer and battery, making it fully autonomous.\nThe robot ships as a DIY kit and can be programmed in Python, with JavaScript and Scratch support planned. Pre-installed demonstration applications include face and hand tracking, smart companion features, and dancing moves. Developers can create and share new applications through Hugging Face’s Spaces platform, potentially creating what Delangue envisions as “thousands, tens of thousands, millions of apps.”\nThis approach contrasts sharply with traditional robotics companies that typically release one product annually with limited customization options. “We want to have a model where we release tons of things,” Delangue explained. “Maybe we’ll release 100 prototypes a year. Out of this 100 prototypes, maybe we’ll assemble only 10 ourselves… and maybe fully assembled, fully packaged, fully integrated with all the software stack, maybe there’s going to be just a couple of them.”\nThe launch represents a fascinating test of whether open-source principles can translate successfully to hardware businesses.Hugging Faceplans to release all hardware designs, software, and assembly instructions as open source, allowing anyone to build their own version. The company monetizes through convenience, selling pre-assembled units to developers who prefer to pay rather than build from scratch.\n“You try to share as much as possible to really empower the community,” Delangue explained. “There are people who, even if they have all the recipes open source to build their own Reachy Mini, would prefer to pay 300 bucks, 500 bucks, and get it already ready, or easy to assemble at home.”\nThis freemium approach for hardware echoes successful software models but faces unique challenges. Manufacturing costs, supply chain complexity, and physical distribution create constraints that don’t exist in pure software businesses. However, Delangue argues this creates valuable feedback loops: “You learn from the open source community about what they want to build, how they want to build, and you can reintegrate it into what you sell.”\nThe move into robotics raises new questions about data privacy and security that don’t exist with purely digital AI systems. Robots equipped with cameras, microphones, and the ability to take physical actions in homes and workplaces create unprecedented privacy considerations.\nDelangue positions open source as the solution to these concerns. “One of my personal motivations to do open source robotics is that I think it’s going to fight concentration of power… the natural tendency of creating black box robots that users don’t really understand or really control,” he said. “The idea of ending up in a world where just a few companies are controlling millions of robots that are in people’s homes, being able to take action in real life, is quite scary.”\nThe open-source approach allows users to inspect code, understand data flows, and potentially run AI models locally rather than relying on cloud services. For enterprise customers, Hugging Face’s existing enterprise platform could provide private deployment options for robotics applications.\nHugging Face faces significant manufacturing and scaling challenges as it transitions from a software platform to a hardware company. The company plans to begin shipping Reachy Mini units as early as next month, starting with more DIY-oriented versions where customers complete final assembly.\n“The first versions, the first orders shipping will be a bit DIY, in the sense that we’ll split the weight of assembling with the user,” Delangue explained. “We’ll do some of the assembling ourselves, and then the user will be doing some of the assembling themselves too.”\nThis approach aligns with the company’s goal of engaging the AI builder community in hands-on robotics development while managing manufacturing complexity. The strategy also reflects uncertainty about market demand for the new product category.\nReachy Mini enters a rapidly evolving robotics landscape.Tesla’s Optimus program,Figure’s humanoid robots, andBoston Dynamics‘ commercial offerings represent the high-end of the market, while companies likeUnitreehave introduced more affordable humanoid robots at around $16,000.\nHugging Face’s approach differs fundamentally from these competitors. Rather than creating a single, highly capable robot, the company is building an ecosystem of affordable, modular, open-source robotics components. Previous releases include theSO-101 robotic arm(starting at $100) and plans for theHopeJR humanoid robot(around $3,000).\nThe strategy reflects broader trends in AI development, where open-source models from companies like Meta and smaller players have challenged closed-source leaders like OpenAI. In January, Chinese Startup DeepSeek shocked the industry by releasing a powerful AI model developed at significantly lower cost than competing systems, demonstrating the potential for open-source approaches to disrupt established players.\nHugging Face’s robotics expansion benefits from strategic partnerships across the industry. The company collaborates withNVIDIA on robotics simulationand training through Isaac Lab, enabling developers to generate synthetic training data and test robot behaviors in virtual environments before deployment.\nThe recent release ofSmolVLA, a 450-million parameter vision-language-action model, demonstrates the technical foundation underlying Reachy Mini. The model is designed to be efficient enough to run on consumer hardware, including MacBooks, making sophisticated AI capabilities accessible to individual developers rather than requiring expensive cloud infrastructure.\nPhysical Intelligence, a Startup co-founded by UC Berkeley professor Sergey Levine, has made itsPi0 robot foundation modelavailable through Hugging Face, creating opportunities for cross-pollination between different robotics approaches. “Making robotics more accessible increases the velocity with which technology advances,” Levine noted in previous statements about open-source robotics.\nTheReachy Minilaunch signals Hugging Face’s ambition to become the dominant platform for AI development across all modalities, not just text and image generation. With robotics representing a potential $38 billion market by 2035, according toGoldman Sachs projections, early platform positioning could prove strategically valuable.\nDelangue envisions a future where hardware becomes an integral part of AI development workflows. “We see hardware as part of the AI builder building blocks,” he explained. “Always with our approach of being open, being community driven, integrating everything with as many community members, as many other organizations as possible.”\nThe company’s financial position provides flexibility to experiment with hardware business models. As a profitable company with significant funding,Hugging Facecan afford to prioritize market development over immediate revenue optimization. Delangue mentioned potential subscription models where Hugging Face platform access could include hardware components, similar to how some software companies bundle services.\nBeyond commercial applications,Reachy Minicould significantly impact robotics education and research. At $299, the robot costs less than many smartphones while providing full programmability and AI integration. Universities, coding bootcamps, and individual learners could use the platform to explore robotics concepts without requiring expensive laboratory equipment.\nThe open-source nature enables educational institutions to modify hardware and software to suit specific curricula. Students could progress from basic programming exercises to sophisticated AI applications using the same platform, potentially accelerating robotics education and workforce development.\nDelangue revealed that community feedback has already influenced product development. A colleague’s five-year-old daughter wanted to carry the robot around the house, leading to the development of the wireless version. “She started to want to take the Reachy Mini and bring it everywhere. That’s when the wires started to be a problem,” he explained.\nHugging Face’s approach could fundamentally alter robotics industry dynamics. Traditional robotics companies invest heavily in proprietary technology, limiting innovation to internal teams. The open-source model could unlock distributed innovation across thousands of developers, potentially accelerating advancement while reducing costs.\nThe strategy mirrors successful disruptions in other technology sectors. Linux challenged proprietary operating systems, Android democratized mobile development, and TensorFlow accelerated machine learning adoption. If successful, Hugging Face’s robotics platform could follow a similar trajectory.\nHowever, hardware presents unique challenges compared to software. Manufacturing quality control, supply chain management, and physical safety requirements create complexity that doesn’t exist in purely digital products. The company’s ability to manage these challenges while maintaining its open-source philosophy will determine the platform’s long-term success.\nWhether Reachy Mini succeeds or fails, its launch marks a pivotal moment in robotics development. For the first time, a major AI platform is betting that the future of robotics belongs not in corporate research labs, but in the hands of millions of individual developers armed with affordable, open-source tools. In an industry long dominated by secrecy and six-figure price tags, that might just be the most revolutionary idea of all.\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The company initiallyunveiled the prototypes of these devices back in May, alongside a larger humanoid robot named HopeJR.\nHugging Face said it plans to release two versions of the Reachy Mini. The first, called the Reachy Mini Wireless, is wireless and costs $449 and runs on a Raspberry 5 mini computer. The second version is the Reachy Mini Lite, which needs to be connected to a computing source ,but is cheaper at $299.\nThe open source robots come in a kit for developers to build themselves. The Reachy Minis are about the size of a standard stuffed animal and come with two screens for eyes and two antennas.\nOnce built, these robots are fully programmable in Python. These devices also come with a set of pre-installed demos and are integrated with theHugging Face Hub, the company’s open source machine learning platform, which gives users access to more than 1.7 million AI models and more than 400,000 datasets.\nClém Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, told TechCrunch they decided to launch two versions of the Reachy Mini based on initial feedback on the company’s original prototype. An early tester found that their five-year-old daughter wanted to be able to take the desktop robot around the house with her. The company figured she wouldn’t be the only one.\n“The goal in the future is to keep carefully getting a lot of feedback like that from users, from the community, that’s how we’ve always been building products at Hugging Face as an open source community platform,” Delangue said. “By the nature of it being open source, it means that people will be able to extend it, modify it, change everything they want.”\nThe target audience for these devices is AI developers, Delangue said. The Reachy Minis allow users to code, build, and test AI applications on the desktop robot.\n“Anyone will be able to build their own specific features and apps for Reachy Mini that then they’ll be able to share with the community,” Delangue said. “So we hope that it’s really going to unleash the creativity of builders to build, you know, millions of different applications, millions of different features that they can share with the community, so that anyone can then, like, plug and play with it.”\nThe Reachy Mini Lite should start shipping next month, with the wireless version shipping later this year. Delangue said it was important for the company to start shipping shortly after orders, as opposed to doing a long pre-order process with an unclear timeline, because they want to get the robots in users’ hands as fast as possible.\nDelangue added this release is really in line with what Hugging Face is targeting for its robotics program in general — open source hardware that gives users complete control.\n“I feel like it’s really important for the future of robotics to be open source, instead of being closed source, black box, [and] concentrated in the hands of a few companies,” Delangue said. “I think it’s quite a scary world to have like millions of robots in people’s home controlled by one company, with customers, users, not really being able to control them, understand them. I would much rather live in a place, or in a world, or in a country, where everyone can have some control over the robots.”\nTopics\nSenior Reporter, Venture\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Nikkei Asia projects that the ASEAN digital payments market could reachUS$2 trillion by 2030, underscoring the massive opportunity.\nIn this article, we unpack key insights from Capco’s latest report,The Future of E-Wallets in Southeast Asia, to explore how automation and the evolution of e-wallets into holistic life apps could become true game-changers, driving scale and shaping the region’s digital payments landscape.\nThe Southeast Asian digital payments market has grown at breathtaking speed, driven by a youthful, tech-savvy population, high smartphone penetration, and a sustained push for financial inclusion. Platforms like TNG eWallet, GrabPay, GCash, and GoPay have revolutionised the way millions of people store, transact, and manage their daily financial needs.\nYet these core payment functions are increasingly commoditised, and no longer enough to capture long-term user loyalty. Consumers are demanding more. And their voices are impossible to ignore, with regional e-wallet adoptionreaching 79% by Q4 2023.\nToday’s users expect a seamless, secure, and intelligent digital companion that helps them navigate broader aspects of their lives, from managing budgets and accessing credit to booking travel or even taking care of their health.\nLife apps will fundamentally depend on automating customer interactions and the processes beneath them. As these platforms integrate financial services, travel, retail, and daily lifestyle offerings into a single scalable ecosystem, automation becomes critical to delivering the frictionless, personalised experiences that users now demand.\nHere are six ways automation can support growth in key areas:\nCustomers should be able to open accounts within minutes, with little documentation, allowing instant and effortless entry into the digital financial ecosystem.\nAdvanced biometric tools, including fingerprint and facial recognition, will enhance security while simplifying the login and transaction experience for the user.\nData-driven insights will enable offerings tailored to each user’s profile, such as adjusting credit limits in real time based on spending patterns, to support responsible and flexible borrowing.\nArtificial intelligence combined with automated risk assessments will enable instant approvals for products like microloans and Buy-Now-Pay-Later, providing faster access to credit.\nIntelligent chatbots will redefine service expectations by resolving queries, tracking transactions, and handling issues around the clock, enhancing user satisfaction at scale.\nAutomated rewards systems that adapt dynamically to user behaviour will deepen engagement and encourage ongoing platform usage.\nThe ambition for e-wallet players is clear: to become the digital and financial companion people cannot live without.\nStaying ahead means going beyond payments and investing in technology that can truly scale, such as cloud-native, API-first systems that keep platforms agile, resilient, and ready to evolve.\nPartnerships will also matter more than ever. By teaming up with e-commerce, transport, and lifestyle brands, e-wallets can build richer, more connected ecosystems that meet people wherever they are.\nRegulation compliance is also mission-critical. As cross-border payments become easier, platforms will need to walk a careful line between pushing innovation forward and keeping regulators onside.\nAbove all, putting customers at the centre is non-negotiable. Artificial intelligence, automation, and data-driven insights will enable hyper-personalised and more accessible financial services, building trust and loyalty in a market where expectations are higher than ever.\nThe players that think boldly, move responsibly, and put their users first will shape Southeast Asia’s next phase of digital e-wallets successfully, and cement their place as financial partners in people’s everyday lives.\nFeatured image: Edited by Fintech News Singapore, based on images byFrolopiaton Palmvia Freepik, andWho is Dannyvia Freepik\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "東南亞電子錢包市場競爭激烈，自動化 (automation) 成為關鍵。為提升競爭力，業者應著重六大自動化策略：簡化開戶流程、導入生物辨識技術、提供客製化金融建議、運用AI加速信用評估及貸款審核、使用智能聊天機器人提升服務、建立動態獎勵系統。  預估至2030年，東協數位支付市場將達2兆美元，自動化將有助於電子錢包平台擴展規模，並發展成整合生活服務的「生活應用程式」(life apps)。  業者需持續創新並遵守法規，以滿足用戶日益增長的期望。\n", "summary": "東南亞電子錢包市場競爭激烈，自動化 (automation) 成為關鍵。為提升競爭力，業者應著重六大自動化策略：簡化開戶流程、導入生物辨識技術、提供客製化金融建議、運用AI加速信用評估及貸款審核、使用智能聊天機器人提升服務、建立動態獎勵系統。  預估至2030年，東協數位支付市場將達2兆美元，自動化將有助於電子錢包平台擴展規模，並發展成整合生活服務的「生活應用程式」(life apps)。  業者需持續創新並遵守法規，以滿足用戶日益增長的期望。"}

The move is as part of a “shareholder-oriented management,” the company said.\n“The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation,” a translated version of the statement reads.”On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.”\nTashiro took over as CEO in June,sayingthat Remixpoint would place BTC “at the core of [its] financial strategy” as part of a shift to make the company focused on treasury management.\nEven before Tashiro’s appointment as CEO, Remixpoint had been acquiring BTC and other cryptocurrencies as part of a reported strategy toward a treasury of digital assets. As of June 13, the companyreportedholding more than 1,051 BTC, 901 Ether (ETH), 13,920 Solana (SOL), 1,191,204XRP, and 2,802,311 Dogecoin (DOGE), representing a combined market value of more than $116 million.\nRelated:Metaplanet eyes digital bank acquisition in phase 2 of Bitcoin strategy\nIn addition to his new role at Remixpoint, Tashiro is listed under the management of BITPoint, a Japan-based crypto exchange and an affiliate of the SBI Group. The exchange has heavily promoted US President Donald Trump’s memecoin Official Trump (TRUMP).\nWhether part of a strategy to further adoption at the company or to try and boost the price of specific cryptocurrencies, Remixpoint was not the first to announce its leadership’s salary would be paid in Bitcoin.\nIn 2021, UK-based cryptocurrency mining company Argo Blockchainsaid its then-CEO, Peter Wall, would receive a BTC salary.

In other words, the GOB token allocation is set aside for the current NFT holder, not the wallet address that held it during an arbitrary snapshot date.\nAdditionally, instead of granting a fully vested allotment of tokens to NFT holders, GOB will vest every second over the course of 24 months, with claims available weekly. (Company and team members have a 30-month vest, with a six-month cliff.)\nAnd that allotment is not designed to be an immediate exit point for holders, as Goblintown aims to launch small—or with a low market cap and tight circulating supply—as opposed to other token launches which may seek to launch with higher market caps and token supplies, offering their communities a strong day one stimulus and exit point.\nLaunch mechanics for other recent meme coins have created “misaligned incentives” between the community and the project, according to Taub, who said that they can seem to be designed “to be done day one.”\n“If I’m holding it, I’m sort of a sucker,” said Taub of launches that pair high valuations with a fully vested allocation on day one. \"We're trying to take the reverse approach.”\nBeyond the token allocations, Taub indicated that Goblintown will be doing its best to deal with snipers, a problem that has plagued Solana meme coins, allowing individuals or bots to snag a coin and create lots of sell pressure shortly after launch.\nTo do so, GOB launched in stealth without a pre-announcement, and directly via the Goblintown community to start. That—coupled with the small percentage of tokens available on day one—isn’t a perfect solution, but “should get us most of the way there,” the project’s GOB Green Paper reads.\nLast but not least, the project will address what it calls the “silent killer”—poor liquidity management—by implementing a 2.5% token tax designed to replenish the liquidity pool, help with operations and marketing, and create a deflationary flywheel with buybacks and burns. In other words, with every transaction a small tax or “fee” will be redirected to the team to support the future of the token.\n“We realized the solution is just a smart and balanced token tax that just gets reinvested back into the token,” Taub said, highlighting the innovation and early success of other token tax examples like that of Safemoon—“before all the crime,”he joked.\nIndividually, each component of the GOB token design has been implemented before elsewhere. But Taub and team think this combination will help sustain their token.\n“People have done vesting before, people have done token taxes before, they’ve done things to try and elbow out snipers,” he said. “They just haven’t ever been all put together, specifically for a meme coin for an NFT project.”\n“We think the market is sort of dying for and hungry for a new token design,” Taub continued. “That’s not a guarantee that it’s going to work, but if you can figure out a better design than what people are currently doing and get the demand, it could work.”\nGoblintown burst onto the scene in 2022 following a plunge in NFT demand, turning a free mint on Ethereum with no utility, roadmap, or Discord into apricey collection with a rabid, urine-obsessed community, using funmarketing gimmicks and the absurdityof the collection to spread the brand. It has sinceexpanded into gaming, as well.\nIt’ll use some of those tactics once more, launching with aTikTok filter called “Sell the Top”to promote the brand, and Telescram, a real hotline encouraging callers to leave detailed messages with love or hate for the token.\n“We just think this at least has potential,” said Taub. “It could die because nobody cares about it; it’s an attention game. But at least we're giving it a punter’s chance.”\nYour gateway into the world of Web3\nThe latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.\n© A next-generation media company.2025Decrypt Media, Inc.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "Goblintown NFT項目於2025年7月9日推出Solana區塊鏈上的新迷因幣GOB。此新幣種旨在解決迷因幣的壽命問題，其多管齊下的方法包括：分階段釋放代幣（token vesting）、低市值發行、反狙擊機制以及2.5%的代幣稅用於回購和銷毀（burn），以改善流動性。此設計整合了先前其他項目各自採用的方法，目標在創造更健康、永續的迷因幣生態。Goblintown團隊期望藉此創新模式吸引社群參與。\n", "summary": "Goblintown NFT項目於2025年7月9日推出Solana區塊鏈上的新迷因幣GOB。此新幣種旨在解決迷因幣的壽命問題，其多管齊下的方法包括：分階段釋放代幣（token vesting）、低市值發行、反狙擊機制以及2.5%的代幣稅用於回購和銷毀（burn），以改善流動性。此設計整合了先前其他項目各自採用的方法，目標在創造更健康、永續的迷因幣生態。Goblintown團隊期望藉此創新模式吸引社群參與。"}

It compares the DOJ’s approach to prosecuting a frying pan manufacturer for what someone cooks in it.\n“By its plain meaning, § 1960 does not stretch that far... one cannot ‘transmit’ or ‘transfer’ funds on someone’s behalf without accepting and relinquishing custody or control,” the brief reads.\nThe brief argues that the DOJ’s stance has sown legal uncertainty, discouraging developers from building privacy-enhancing tools or decentralized financial infrastructure.\nThe lobby group warned that if the legal environment doesn’t change, innovation will migrate offshore. “Faced with possible prosecution [...] developers of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfer software will choose to either move offshore or stop creating their tools altogether.”\nThe filing comes as the DOJ continues to pursue cases like US v. Storm and US v. Rodriguez, where programmers behindtools such as Tornado Cashare facing criminal charges under the same statute.\nThe brief urged the court to reject the motion to dismiss and allow the case to proceed, saying only a declaratory judgment can clarify the law and safeguard US neutral software development.\nRelated:The open source debate: Is crypto losing its soul?\nOn Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuitdismissed Coin Center’s lawsuit againstthe US Treasury Department over its 2022 sanctions on Tornado Cash.\nThe dismissal came through a joint agreement between Coin Center and the Treasury, effectively ending the crypto advocacy group’s legal challenge to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s designation of the mixing service.\nCoin Center initiallyargued that the Treasury exceededits legal authority by sanctioning smart contracts and associated wallet addresses.

Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders.Subscribe Now\nHugging Face, the $4.5 billion artificial intelligence platform that has become the GitHub of machine learning, announced Tuesday the launch ofReachy Mini, a $299 desktop robot designed to bring AI-powered robotics to millions of developers worldwide. The 11-inch humanoid companion represents the company’s boldest move yet to democratize robotics development and challenge the industry’s traditional closed-source, high-cost model.\nThe announcement comes as Hugging Face crosses a significant milestone of 10 million AI builders using its platform, with CEO Clément Delangue revealing in an exclusive interview that “more and more of them are building in relation to robotics.” The compact robot, which can sit on any desk next to a laptop, addresses what Delangue calls a fundamental barrier in robotics development: accessibility.\n“One of the challenges with robotics is that you know you can’t just build on your laptop. You need to have some sort of robotics partner to help in your building, and most people won’t be able to buy $70,000 robots,” Delangue explained, referring to traditional industrial robotics systems and even newer humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus, which is expected to cost $20,000-$30,000.\nReachy Miniemerges from Hugging Face’s April acquisition of French robotics StartupPollen Robotics, marking the company’s most significant hardware expansion since its founding. The robot represents the first consumer product to integrate natively with theHugging Face Hub, allowing developers to access thousands of pre-built AI models and share robotics applications through the platform’s “Spaces” feature.\nThe timing appears deliberate as the AI industry grapples with the next frontier: physical AI. While large language models have dominated the past two years, industry leaders increasingly believe that artificial intelligence will need physical embodiment to achieve human-level capabilities.Goldman Sachsprojects the humanoid robotics market could reach $38 billion by 2035, while theWorld Economic Forumidentifies robotics as a critical frontier technology for industrial operations.\n“We’re seeing more and more people moving to robotics, which is extremely exciting,” Delangue said. “The idea is to really become the desktop, open-source robot for AI builders.”\nReachy Minipacks sophisticated capabilities into its compact form factor. The robot features six degrees of freedom in its moving head, full body rotation, animated antennas, a wide-angle camera, multiple microphones, and a 5-watt speaker. The wireless version includes aRaspberry Pi 5computer and battery, making it fully autonomous.\nThe robot ships as a DIY kit and can be programmed in Python, with JavaScript and Scratch support planned. Pre-installed demonstration applications include face and hand tracking, smart companion features, and dancing moves. Developers can create and share new applications through Hugging Face’s Spaces platform, potentially creating what Delangue envisions as “thousands, tens of thousands, millions of apps.”\nThis approach contrasts sharply with traditional robotics companies that typically release one product annually with limited customization options. “We want to have a model where we release tons of things,” Delangue explained. “Maybe we’ll release 100 prototypes a year. Out of this 100 prototypes, maybe we’ll assemble only 10 ourselves… and maybe fully assembled, fully packaged, fully integrated with all the software stack, maybe there’s going to be just a couple of them.”\nThe launch represents a fascinating test of whether open-source principles can translate successfully to hardware businesses.Hugging Faceplans to release all hardware designs, software, and assembly instructions as open source, allowing anyone to build their own version. The company monetizes through convenience, selling pre-assembled units to developers who prefer to pay rather than build from scratch.\n“You try to share as much as possible to really empower the community,” Delangue explained. “There are people who, even if they have all the recipes open source to build their own Reachy Mini, would prefer to pay 300 bucks, 500 bucks, and get it already ready, or easy to assemble at home.”\nThis freemium approach for hardware echoes successful software models but faces unique challenges. Manufacturing costs, supply chain complexity, and physical distribution create constraints that don’t exist in pure software businesses. However, Delangue argues this creates valuable feedback loops: “You learn from the open source community about what they want to build, how they want to build, and you can reintegrate it into what you sell.”\nThe move into robotics raises new questions about data privacy and security that don’t exist with purely digital AI systems. Robots equipped with cameras, microphones, and the ability to take physical actions in homes and workplaces create unprecedented privacy considerations.\nDelangue positions open source as the solution to these concerns. “One of my personal motivations to do open source robotics is that I think it’s going to fight concentration of power… the natural tendency of creating black box robots that users don’t really understand or really control,” he said. “The idea of ending up in a world where just a few companies are controlling millions of robots that are in people’s homes, being able to take action in real life, is quite scary.”\nThe open-source approach allows users to inspect code, understand data flows, and potentially run AI models locally rather than relying on cloud services. For enterprise customers, Hugging Face’s existing enterprise platform could provide private deployment options for robotics applications.\nHugging Face faces significant manufacturing and scaling challenges as it transitions from a software platform to a hardware company. The company plans to begin shipping Reachy Mini units as early as next month, starting with more DIY-oriented versions where customers complete final assembly.\n“The first versions, the first orders shipping will be a bit DIY, in the sense that we’ll split the weight of assembling with the user,” Delangue explained. “We’ll do some of the assembling ourselves, and then the user will be doing some of the assembling themselves too.”\nThis approach aligns with the company’s goal of engaging the AI builder community in hands-on robotics development while managing manufacturing complexity. The strategy also reflects uncertainty about market demand for the new product category.\nReachy Mini enters a rapidly evolving robotics landscape.Tesla’s Optimus program,Figure’s humanoid robots, andBoston Dynamics‘ commercial offerings represent the high-end of the market, while companies likeUnitreehave introduced more affordable humanoid robots at around $16,000.\nHugging Face’s approach differs fundamentally from these competitors. Rather than creating a single, highly capable robot, the company is building an ecosystem of affordable, modular, open-source robotics components. Previous releases include theSO-101 robotic arm(starting at $100) and plans for theHopeJR humanoid robot(around $3,000).\nThe strategy reflects broader trends in AI development, where open-source models from companies like Meta and smaller players have challenged closed-source leaders like OpenAI. In January, Chinese Startup DeepSeek shocked the industry by releasing a powerful AI model developed at significantly lower cost than competing systems, demonstrating the potential for open-source approaches to disrupt established players.\nHugging Face’s robotics expansion benefits from strategic partnerships across the industry. The company collaborates withNVIDIA on robotics simulationand training through Isaac Lab, enabling developers to generate synthetic training data and test robot behaviors in virtual environments before deployment.\nThe recent release ofSmolVLA, a 450-million parameter vision-language-action model, demonstrates the technical foundation underlying Reachy Mini. The model is designed to be efficient enough to run on consumer hardware, including MacBooks, making sophisticated AI capabilities accessible to individual developers rather than requiring expensive cloud infrastructure.\nPhysical Intelligence, a Startup co-founded by UC Berkeley professor Sergey Levine, has made itsPi0 robot foundation modelavailable through Hugging Face, creating opportunities for cross-pollination between different robotics approaches. “Making robotics more accessible increases the velocity with which technology advances,” Levine noted in previous statements about open-source robotics.\nTheReachy Minilaunch signals Hugging Face’s ambition to become the dominant platform for AI development across all modalities, not just text and image generation. With robotics representing a potential $38 billion market by 2035, according toGoldman Sachs projections, early platform positioning could prove strategically valuable.\nDelangue envisions a future where hardware becomes an integral part of AI development workflows. “We see hardware as part of the AI builder building blocks,” he explained. “Always with our approach of being open, being community driven, integrating everything with as many community members, as many other organizations as possible.”\nThe company’s financial position provides flexibility to experiment with hardware business models. As a profitable company with significant funding,Hugging Facecan afford to prioritize market development over immediate revenue optimization. Delangue mentioned potential subscription models where Hugging Face platform access could include hardware components, similar to how some software companies bundle services.\nBeyond commercial applications,Reachy Minicould significantly impact robotics education and research. At $299, the robot costs less than many smartphones while providing full programmability and AI integration. Universities, coding bootcamps, and individual learners could use the platform to explore robotics concepts without requiring expensive laboratory equipment.\nThe open-source nature enables educational institutions to modify hardware and software to suit specific curricula. Students could progress from basic programming exercises to sophisticated AI applications using the same platform, potentially accelerating robotics education and workforce development.\nDelangue revealed that community feedback has already influenced product development. A colleague’s five-year-old daughter wanted to carry the robot around the house, leading to the development of the wireless version. “She started to want to take the Reachy Mini and bring it everywhere. That’s when the wires started to be a problem,” he explained.\nHugging Face’s approach could fundamentally alter robotics industry dynamics. Traditional robotics companies invest heavily in proprietary technology, limiting innovation to internal teams. The open-source model could unlock distributed innovation across thousands of developers, potentially accelerating advancement while reducing costs.\nThe strategy mirrors successful disruptions in other technology sectors. Linux challenged proprietary operating systems, Android democratized mobile development, and TensorFlow accelerated machine learning adoption. If successful, Hugging Face’s robotics platform could follow a similar trajectory.\nHowever, hardware presents unique challenges compared to software. Manufacturing quality control, supply chain management, and physical safety requirements create complexity that doesn’t exist in purely digital products. The company’s ability to manage these challenges while maintaining its open-source philosophy will determine the platform’s long-term success.\nWhether Reachy Mini succeeds or fails, its launch marks a pivotal moment in robotics development. For the first time, a major AI platform is betting that the future of robotics belongs not in corporate research labs, but in the hands of millions of individual developers armed with affordable, open-source tools. In an industry long dominated by secrecy and six-figure price tags, that might just be the most revolutionary idea of all.\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

This leads due to massive VC backing, like Binance’s $2 billion raise, and growing institutional demand for secure, compliant trading infrastructure.\nChatGPT is often misunderstood as simply a chatbot. In reality, traders can use it as an AI-powered research assistant, especially when paired with data from tools like L2BEAT, Artemis, Token Terminal and customGitHubscrapers.\nFor example, a trader might prompt ChatGPT to compare GitHub activity acrossmodular blockchain projects, cross-reference it withtotal value locked (TVL)and check if transaction fees are rising. Given that structure, ChatGPT summarizes insights that would otherwise take hours of manual browsing.\nSample workflow prompt:\n“Summarize the last 7 days of GitHub activity (commits, releases, key updates) for ZKsync and Starknet, and correlate that with recent trends in user adoption and protocol revenue using Artemis data. Keep the results short, clear, and easy to understand.”\nAccording to ChatGPT, as shown in the image below, ZKsync Era and Starknet ecosystems are showing steady developer activity with regular releases and commits. Additionally, Starknet leads in protocol revenue, posting $751,000 in gross profit with $127 million TVL, while ZKsync shows $600,000 total revenue since Q3 2024.\nX remains the fastest place to detect when something is catching fire, long before news sites or analysts write about it.\nIts key strengths include:\nLive tweets from developers, influencers and degens.\nReal-time buzz, memes and token spikes.\nRapid insights into sentiment shifts.\nSmarttradersmonitor X accounts like:\n@Dune — for weekly onchain metrics\n@cryptokoryo — for narrative alerts\n@punk9059 — for data-driven meme trends\nThe above screenshot shows a post from @Dune summarizing the top five onchain developments of the week in their “Dune Digest.” For traders, this is a valuable snapshot of real-time activity, highlighting trends like EulerSwap’s $300 million beta volume and KaiaChain adding native Tether USDt (USDT), which can signal growing ecosystems or upcoming narrative plays. Following such updates helps traders act early on protocols gaining traction before wider market attention.\nAdditionally, you may use X search filters like:\n(“stablecoin” OR “USDe” OR “Ethena” OR “GHO” OR “Mountain Protocol”) min_faves:50 lang:en since:2025-01-01\nThis is a special X search trick that helps you find popular tweets (50+ likes) about specific stablecoins like USDe, Ethena or GHO, posted in 2025 and in English. It’s useful for beginners because it filters out spam and shows you only the most talked-about posts, so you can spot which crypto projects are trending and why.\nBased on the above X search filter for trending stablecoin content, this tweet surfaced showing that Ethena’s USDe was gaining traction across Aave and Pendle (see image below), with over $2 billion in PT (Principal Token) locked. It highlights how USDe holders can stack multiple yield layers, offering valuable alpha for DeFi-focused traders.\nWhen comparing ChatGPT and X for identifying emerging crypto narratives, each serves a distinct purpose.ChatGPT excels at structured research, summarizing complex topics, comparing protocols and analyzing trends based on historical and broad-context data. It offers low-noise, logically organized insights, but may lack the most up-to-date information unless connected to live web tools.\nIn contrast, X provides real-time updates and social sentiment from developers, influencers and communities. It’s fast and dynamic, ideal for early signals but comes with high noise, misinformation risk and hype-driven content.\nFor strategic decision-making, ChatGPT helps validate and contextualize. For instant awareness and trend detection, X leads with speed. The best results often come from using both in tandem.\nExperienced crypto users often utilize both ChatGPT and X together, using ChatGPT for structured analysis and X for real-time updates, rather than relying on just one.\nSpot a buzzing trend on X:\nSee multiple tweets about “AI + Crypto wallets” or “restaking on Bitcoin.”\nValidate with ChatGPT:\nAsk, “What projects are building AI-integrated wallets, and are they gaining real traction?”\nAct with confidence:\nAllocate small capital to a promising token, monitor narrative momentum and track exit signals.\nMay be outdated if not browsing-enabled, especially in a fast-moving market like crypto.\nOutput depends on prompt quality; unclear queries can lead to vague or generic answers.\nCan miss emerging narratives that haven’t been widely documented yet.\nHigh chance of misinformation, hype or shilled tokens with no fundamentals.\nProne to herd behavior and echo chambers, especially during market volatility.\nDifficult for beginners to separate signal from noise, even with filters.\nUsing both tools with awareness of their limitations and backing insights with onchain or market data can help minimize risk while maximizing edge.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "加密貨幣交易者利用ChatGPT (AI-powered research)及X (real-time social sentiment)平台尋找早期訊號。ChatGPT擅長分析趨勢、比較協議，提供數據支持的研究型決策；X則提供即時市場情緒和早期趨勢預警。但ChatGPT資料可能過時，X則充斥噪音和錯誤訊息。結合兩者，能有效驗證即時熱點，降低投資風險，提升獲利機會。  利用ChatGPT佐證X平台上發現的熱門趨勢，例如「AI+加密錢包」，可有效提升投資決策的準確性。  需注意兩者皆有其局限性，需謹慎使用。\n", "summary": "加密貨幣交易者利用ChatGPT (AI-powered research)及X (real-time social sentiment)平台尋找早期訊號。ChatGPT擅長分析趨勢、比較協議，提供數據支持的研究型決策；X則提供即時市場情緒和早期趨勢預警。但ChatGPT資料可能過時，X則充斥噪音和錯誤訊息。結合兩者，能有效驗證即時熱點，降低投資風險，提升獲利機會。  利用ChatGPT佐證X平台上發現的熱門趨勢，例如「AI+加密錢包」，可有效提升投資決策的準確性。  需注意兩者皆有其局限性，需謹慎使用。"}

Make sure the summary is useful and meaningful for internal teams, focusing on the most relevant information.\n\n\nInput:\nTitle: ChatGPT vs X: Which is better at first spotting the next big crypto narrative?\nArticle Content: Crypto traders use ChatGPT and X to catch early signals, combining AI-driven analysis with real-time sentiment. But each comes with its risks.\nChatGPT is ideal for comparing protocols, understanding trends and filtering out noise for research-based decisions.\nX provides real-time sentiment and early signals, making it useful for catching trending narratives before they hit mainstream news.\nEach tool has risks: ChatGPT can be outdated without live data, while X carries high noise and misinformation risk.\nCombining both tools gives traders the best edge, enabling them to validate real-time hype with data-backed insights.\nIn crypto, timing is everything. Spotting the next big crypto narrative, whether restaking, DePINs or RWAs, can put savvy traders miles ahead of the crowd. But in asea of information, where should you turn for early insights?\nTwo powerful tools dominate the space:\nChatGPT (AI-powered research)\nX (real-time social sentiment)\nWhich one is better at spotting the next big altcoin trend before it hits the mainstream? Let’s break it down with real-world examples and use cases you can act on.\nIn crypto, narratives drive capital faster than fundamentals. Whether it’s restaking,Bitcoin layer-2sorDePIN, once the narrative catches fire, token prices often follow.\nExamples include:\n$HAWK soared to $500M+ after beingmemed by Haliey Welch, then dumped fast.\n$LIBRA, hyped by Argentina’s President Javier Milei, surged, then crashed in a matter of days.\nAI x Crypto agentslike Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol saw sharp interest due to the “AI + Token” fusion narrative.\nChatGPT is ideal for analyzing trends, comparing ecosystems and understanding the why behind each narrative.\nIts key strengths include:\nSummarizes VC flows, developer activity and user adoption.\nHelps you compare protocols and understand hype vs reality.\nGenerates strategic prompts, thesis frameworks and ecosystem maps.\nYou may use this prompt:\n“What is the most promising narrative in crypto for 2025 based on venture capital investment and ecosystem growth?”\nAs shown in the image below, according to ChatGPT, “Institutional Infrastructure & Exchanges” is the most important crypto narrative for 2025. This leads due to massive VC backing, like Binance’s $2 billion raise, and growing institutional demand for secure, compliant trading infrastructure.\nChatGPT is often misunderstood as simply a chatbot. In reality, traders can use it as an AI-powered research assistant, especially when paired with data from tools like L2BEAT, Artemis, Token Terminal and customGitHubscrapers.\nFor example, a trader might prompt ChatGPT to compare GitHub activity acrossmodular blockchain projects, cross-reference it withtotal value locked (TVL)and check if transaction fees are rising. Given that structure, ChatGPT summarizes insights that would otherwise take hours of manual browsing.\nSample workflow prompt:\n“Summarize the last 7 days of GitHub activity (commits, releases, key updates) for ZKsync and Starknet, and correlate that with recent trends in user adoption and protocol revenue using Artemis data. Keep the results short, clear, and easy to understand.”\nAccording to ChatGPT, as shown in the image below, ZKsync Era and Starknet ecosystems are showing steady developer activity with regular releases and commits. Additionally, Starknet leads in protocol revenue, posting $751,000 in gross profit with $127 million TVL, while ZKsync shows $600,000 total revenue since Q3 2024.\nX remains the fastest place to detect when something is catching fire, long before news sites or analysts write about it.\nIts key strengths include:\nLive tweets from developers, influencers and degens.\nReal-time buzz, memes and token spikes.\nRapid insights into sentiment shifts.\nSmarttradersmonitor X accounts like:\n@Dune — for weekly onchain metrics\n@cryptokoryo — for narrative alerts\n@punk9059 — for data-driven meme trends\nThe above screenshot shows a post from @Dune summarizing the top five onchain developments of the week in their “Dune Digest.” For traders, this is a valuable snapshot of real-time activity, highlighting trends like EulerSwap’s $300 million beta volume and KaiaChain adding native Tether USDt (USDT), which can signal growing ecosystems or upcoming narrative plays. Following such updates helps traders act early on protocols gaining traction before wider market attention.\nAdditionally, you may use X search filters like:\n(“stablecoin” OR “USDe” OR “Ethena” OR “GHO” OR “Mountain Protocol”) min_faves:50 lang:en since:2025-01-01\nThis is a special X search trick that helps you find popular tweets (50+ likes) about specific stablecoins like USDe, Ethena or GHO, posted in 2025 and in English. It’s useful for beginners because it filters out spam and shows you only the most talked-about posts, so you can spot which crypto projects are trending and why.\nBased on the above X search filter for trending stablecoin content, this tweet surfaced showing that Ethena’s USDe was gaining traction across Aave and Pendle (see image below), with over $2 billion in PT (Principal Token) locked. It highlights how USDe holders can stack multiple yield layers, offering valuable alpha for DeFi-focused traders.\nWhen comparing ChatGPT and X for identifying emerging crypto narratives, each serves a distinct purpose.ChatGPT excels at structured research, summarizing complex topics, comparing protocols and analyzing trends based on historical and broad-context data. It offers low-noise, logically organized insights, but may lack the most up-to-date information unless connected to live web tools.\nIn contrast, X provides real-time updates and social sentiment from developers, influencers and communities. It’s fast and dynamic, ideal for early signals but comes with high noise, misinformation risk and hype-driven content.\nFor strategic decision-making, ChatGPT helps validate and contextualize. For instant awareness and trend detection, X leads with speed. The best results often come from using both in tandem.\nExperienced crypto users often utilize both ChatGPT and X together, using ChatGPT for structured analysis and X for real-time updates, rather than relying on just one.\nSpot a buzzing trend on X:\nSee multiple tweets about “AI + Crypto wallets” or “restaking on Bitcoin.”\nValidate with ChatGPT:\nAsk, “What projects are building AI-integrated wallets, and are they gaining real traction?”\nAct with confidence:\nAllocate small capital to a promising token, monitor narrative momentum and track exit signals.\nMay be outdated if not browsing-enabled, especially in a fast-moving market like crypto.\nOutput depends on prompt quality; unclear queries can lead to vague or generic answers.\nCan miss emerging narratives that haven’t been widely documented yet.\nHigh chance of misinformation, hype or shilled tokens with no fundamentals.\nProne to herd behavior and echo chambers, especially during market volatility.\nDifficult for beginners to separate signal from noise, even with filters.\nUsing both tools with awareness of their limitations and backing insights with onchain or market data can help minimize risk while maximizing edge.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "加密貨幣交易員運用ChatGPT (AI-powered research)及X (即時社群情緒)平台捕捉早期訊號。ChatGPT擅長分析趨勢、比較協議，利於研究型決策；X則提供即時情緒和早期警示，有助於捕捉主流新聞之前的熱門話題。然而，ChatGPT資料可能過時，X則充斥雜訊及錯誤資訊。  結合兩者優點，驗證即時熱度及數據洞察，方能提升交易策略。  及早發現新興敘事（例如restaking, DePINs或RWAs）對交易至關重要。\n", "summary": "加密貨幣交易員運用ChatGPT (AI-powered research)及X (即時社群情緒)平台捕捉早期訊號。ChatGPT擅長分析趨勢、比較協議，利於研究型決策；X則提供即時情緒和早期警示，有助於捕捉主流新聞之前的熱門話題。然而，ChatGPT資料可能過時，X則充斥雜訊及錯誤資訊。  結合兩者優點，驗證即時熱度及數據洞察，方能提升交易策略。  及早發現新興敘事（例如restaking, DePINs或RWAs）對交易至關重要。"}

Make sure the summary is useful and meaningful for internal teams, focusing on the most relevant information.\n\n\nInput:\nTitle: 【打破 AI 記憶瓶頸】中國研究推出首個 AI「記憶作業系統」MemOS，稱比 OpenAI 準確逾 38%\nArticle Content: 現在的 AI 大型語言模型（LLM）雖然具備強大生成能力，卻普遍缺乏「持續性記憶」能力。舉例來說，前一次在 AI 對話提到的飲食禁忌，下一次請 AI 推薦餐廳時就會被遺忘；或在某個 AI 平台上建立的洞察和知識，無法延續到另一個平台。這種研究人員稱為「記憶孤島」的問題，限制了 AI 系統在人機關係、長期任務與個人化應用的發展潛力。\n為了解決此問題，《VentureBeat》報導，中國一個研究團隊近日發表一套名為MemOS的系統，聲稱打造出全球首個 AI「記憶作業系統」（Memory Operating System），將記憶體視為可調度、可演化的核心運算資源，類似傳統作業系統對 CPU 或儲存空間的管理方式。該專案由上海交通大學、浙江大學等機構聯合開發，於 7/4 發表在論文平台 arXiv。\n研究團隊指出，現有的 AI 模型（如 ChatGPT）主要依賴靜態參數和短期上下文，雖然提供記憶功能，但仍存在容量限制、存取不穩定、更新不透明以及不可編輯等問題，屬於「被動記錄」而非「結構化管理」，因此難支援個人化與長期任務。在研究中，OpenAI ChatGPT 的記憶功能被描述為一種商業化閉源模組，內部運作不透明。\n儘管檢索增強生成（RAG）技術能即時呼叫外部知識，但研究團隊認為，這僅是暫時解法，缺乏記憶體管理與知識演進能力。因此，他們提出 MemOS 架構，讓 AI 記憶具備生命週期管理、跨平台遷移、記憶體類型間的動態轉換和調度、為大型語言模型更高的可控性和演化能力，奠定 AI 模型個人化的基礎。\n根據研究團隊說明，MemOS 在針對記憶密集型推理任務的 LOCOMO 基準測試中， 於時間推理、多步推理、開放領域與單步推理任務的平均分數超越現有 AI 系統；與 OpenAI 相比，MemOS 的推理準確率提升 38.97%，省下超過 60.95% 的 token 使用量。\n效能提升的關鍵，在於系統導入研究團隊命名為「MemCubes」的標準化記憶單元，能封裝從自然語言到模型內部參數等多類型資訊，並支援時間上的組合、遷移與演化。《VentureBeat》指出，這證明「記憶瓶頸」對 AI 發展的關鍵性，遠高於過去產業普遍認知。\n隨著企業越來越仰賴 AI，又需和客戶、員工建立持續且複雜的關係，MemOS 有望帶來新的 AI 部署方式。舉例來說，行銷團隊可能在 ChatGPT 建立了詳細的消費者角色模型，但換到其他工具規劃行銷活動時又須重建；而 MemOS 則透過標準化記憶格式，實現系統間的記憶遷移。\n該研究還提出「付費記憶模組」的商業化概念，也就是專家可將領域知識封裝成可以購買的記憶單元。例如經驗豐富的醫師則可將診斷準則、問診流程與典型病例進行打包，提供正在臨床實習的醫學生於 AI 系統使用。\n《VentureBeat》指出，這種模式可能顛覆專業知識的變現與傳遞方式，不只創造專家的新收入模式，也有助於促進高品質知識的民主化流通，讓企業能更快速地部署具備深度專業知識的 AI 系統。\n為推動技術應用，團隊已將 MemOS 在 GitHub 上開源，並支援 HuggingFace、OpenAI、Ollama 等主流平台整合，以促進採用與社群參與。\n\n＊本文開放合作夥伴轉載，資料來源：《VentureBeat》、arXiv、MemOS，首圖來源：AI 工具生成\n還在靠社群媒體追新聞嗎？馬上訂閱電子報，最新科技趨勢、熱門活動不漏接！\n感謝訂閱！請隨時注意信箱的最新資訊\n訂閱發生異常，請稍候再試或聯繫客服信箱[email protected]\n訂閱即同意個資蒐集聲明，並允許 Fusionmedium 使用您的個人資料，及接收不定期活動資訊。\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "上海交通大學等團隊開發出AI記憶作業系統(Memory Operating System) MemOS，解決大型語言模型(LLM)「記憶孤島」問題。MemOS將記憶體視為核心運算資源，並透過標準化記憶單元MemCubes，提升AI推理準確率，相較OpenAI提升38.97%。此系統已開源並支援主流平台整合，未來更可能發展「付費記憶模組」商業模式，讓專業知識能標準化交易。MemOS 有望改變AI部署方式，提升企業應用效率。\n", "summary": "上海交通大學等團隊開發出AI記憶作業系統(Memory Operating System) MemOS，解決大型語言模型(LLM)「記憶孤島」問題。MemOS將記憶體視為核心運算資源，並透過標準化記憶單元MemCubes，提升AI推理準確率，相較OpenAI提升38.97%。此系統已開源並支援主流平台整合，未來更可能發展「付費記憶模組」商業模式，讓專業知識能標準化交易。MemOS 有望改變AI部署方式，提升企業應用效率。"}

However, app makers still have to rely on either shipping full beta versions of their apps or using simulation software to gauge how upcoming features will work.\nBlok, a company that is coming out of stealth, allows developers to use AI to simulate different user personas to test an app’s features and learn how to make their apps better.\nThe company was founded by Tom Charman and Olivia Higgs in 2024. Both have been serial entrepreneurs and worked on Startups together in areas includingtravelandlearning.\nTo date, the Startup has raised $7.5 million across two rounds. Its seed round of $5 million was led by MaC Venture Capital, with participation from people working at Discord, Google, Meta, Apple, Snapchat, and Pinterest. Blok’s pre-seed round was with Protagonist with participation from Rackhouse, Ryan Hoover’s Weekend Fund, and Blank Ventures.\nMarlon Nichols, managing GP at MaC Venture Capital, said that Blok is often compared to Optimizely and Amplitude, but those tools are more reactive. He said that Blok is edging them out by providing a predictive layer of testing for apps.\n“We backed Blok because we believe product development is at an inflection point. Teams are shipping faster than ever, but they’re still making critical decisions based on A/B tests and gut instinct. Blok’s simulation engine flips that model — giving teams the ability to predict user behavior before a single line of code is written,” he told TechCrunch over email.\nHiggs said that the need for testing is increasing as the complexity of interfaces has increased over time. She mentioned that they interviewed more than 100 product engineers to understand problems faced by product teams.\n“There is a real need for increased testing because the bar for visual interfaces is getting a lot higher. We’re seeing people interact with technology through chat, through voice. So if you’re introducing visual UI [elements] into the mix, you have to make sure that you are not introducing unnecessary friction into a user’s workflow,” she said.\nCharman said that both big and small companies face different problems. While small companies don’t have cohorts to test out their products and get live feedback, big companies want to avoid stuffing features into their apps and making them clunky.\n“We are trying to reach a place where companies don’t need to release their features on an experimental basis and wait for a few weeks or months for results to show up,” he said.\nWhen a customer starts working with Blok, they upload their event log data from Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Segment. Blok then performs behavioral modeling and creates different user personas for app makers to test. These personas would roughly cover most of an app’s user base.\nThen the development team submits a Figma design and experiment details — including the hypothesis they want to test and the user goal they want to achieve — to Blok, and the user persona agents then try to run the simulation many times. At the end, Blok will show insights about how users would use a particular feature and give recommendations.\nThese insights include an overall report of the experiment and details about what went well and what could be improved. Teams can also look at a persona-wise report and suggestions. Plus, because it is 2025, there is a chatbot that you can ask queries about your experiment.\nBlok has put its product behind a waitlist and is working with an initial set of customers, largely developing solutions in finance and healthcare. The Startup said these areas are ideal to target as they can’t put out bad experiments in public and play around with the product a lot.\nThe Startup charges companies through a SaaS model, but it is also figuring out how to balance out compute costs.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\nToday in crypto, GMX has paused trading after a liquidity pool exploit drained over $40 million. Bybit has confirmed details of the upcoming Pump.fun token sale, and the US has sanctioned a North Korean IT worker ring accused of targeting American companies.\nThe GMX protocolhalted trading on GMX V1after a liquidity pool suffered an exploit on Wednesday, leading to $40 million in funds being stolen and sent to an unknown wallet.\nGMX V1 is the first version of the GMX perpetual exchange deployed on the Arbitrum network. The attacked pool is a liquidity provider for the GMX protocol with a basket of underlying digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and stablecoins,accordingto the GMX team.\nThe protocol has also announced a temporary suspension in minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both Arbitrum and the layer-1 Avalanche network to protect against any additional fallout from the cybersecurity exploit.\nUsers of the platform wereinstructedto disable leverage and change their settings to disable GLP minting.\nBlockchain security company SlowMistattributedthe exploit to a design flaw that allowed hackers to manipulate the GLP token price through the calculation of the total assets under management.\nBybit has confirmeddetails of the much-awaited Pump.fun token sale, revealing that users registered through its European Union-regulated platform, Bybit.eu, will not be able to participate, citing compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nThe public sale of PUMP, the native token of the no-code memecoin launchpad Pump.fun, will open on Saturday at 14:00 UTC and run through Tuesday, according to a Wednesday press release shared with Cointelegraph.A total of 150 billion PUMP tokens, 15% of the 1 trillion total supply, will be offered at a fixed price of $0.004 USDT per token.\nBybit, currently the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is the only major platform participating in the sale, the announcement said. A number of other exchanges will also support the token sale.\nBybit will support subscriptions in USDt (USDT), USDC (USDC), Solana (SOL) and bbSOL, providing access to both stablecoins and Solana-native assets.\nBybit has become the second major crypto exchange to reveal details about the upcoming PUMP token sale, following a slip by Gate.io. On Tuesday, Gate.io briefly published apage outlining a $600 million PUMP token sale, which was quickly taken down.\nIn a Wednesday post on X shortly after the sale was revealed by Bybit, Pump.fun officially announced the token sale. “Our plan is to Kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the platformwrote.\nPump.fun, launched in January 2024, quickly rose to prominence for enabling users to create and trade memecoins with zero coding skills. The platform’s gamified interface and viral mechanics have driven a wave of onchain experimentation on Solana, transforming casual users into active token creators and traders.\nThe US Treasury on Tuesday sanctioned two people, a North Korean and Russian man, along with four entities involved in what it says was a North Korea-run IT worker ring that infiltrates US crypto companies aiming to exploit them.\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) slapped sanctions on the North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for allegedly stealing US citizens’ information to use as aliases and giving the information to hired foreign IT workers who would seek employment at US companies.\nOFAC also sanctioned the Russian national Gayk Asatryan for allegedly using his four Russia-based companies to employ dozens of North Korean IT workers. OFAC said North Korea aims to bankroll its missile programs by deploying a thousands-strong workforce of highly skilled IT workers all over the world.\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender.\nNorth Korea has been notorious for its high-profile hacks such as the $1.5 billion exploit against crypto exchange Bybit exploit in February, but TRM Labs said the nation is starting to shift to “deception-based revenue generation, including IT worker infiltration.”\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "GMX V1 (GMX V1)平台遭駭客攻擊，損失超過4000萬美元資產，並暫停交易及GLP代幣鑄造與贖回。Bybit確認將參與Pump.fun代幣銷售，但歐盟地區用戶因MiCA法規限制無法參與。美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的IT人員網絡，該網絡涉嫌攻擊美國公司竊取資產。Pump.fun平台旨在打造無程式碼的迷因幣發射台。北韓藉由派遣大量IT人員從事網路攻擊，企圖繞過制裁。\n", "summary": "GMX V1 (GMX V1)平台遭駭客攻擊，損失超過4000萬美元資產，並暫停交易及GLP代幣鑄造與贖回。Bybit確認將參與Pump.fun代幣銷售，但歐盟地區用戶因MiCA法規限制無法參與。美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的IT人員網絡，該網絡涉嫌攻擊美國公司竊取資產。Pump.fun平台旨在打造無程式碼的迷因幣發射台。北韓藉由派遣大量IT人員從事網路攻擊，企圖繞過制裁。"}

The funds were raised through Remixpoint’s 25th series of stock acquisition rights and fourth series of unsecured bonds,accordingto local media outlet CoinPost.\nThis series of stock acquisition rights will create 55 million new shares, representing a 39.9% dilution. The issuance is made without any discount and is conducted at market price.\nThe post also states that the firm aims for its reserve to reach 3,000 BTC in the near term. Remixpoint is currently the 30th largest corporate Bitcoin treasury with a balance of 1,051 BTC, worth more than $113.8 million,accordingto BitcoinTreasuries.NET data.\nThe news follows a Tuesday announcement that Remixpoint CEO TakashiTashiro will be paid in Bitcoinas part of stated efforts to be “in the same boat” as shareholders. The company is a Tokyo-listed energy and fintech firm that pivoted to accumulating Bitcoin.\n“We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions,” the company said on Tuesday.\nRelated:Few Bitcoin treasury companies will survive ‘death spiral’: VC Report\nThe company’s board unanimously approved the investment strategy, citing the potential to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective while preserving future flexibility:\nRelated:New Bitcoin treasuries may crack under price pressure\nThe number of corporate Bitcoin treasuries continues to grow, likely driven by the success of early adopters and market dynamics.

However, app makers still have to rely on either shipping full beta versions of their apps or using simulation software to gauge how upcoming features will work.\nBlok, a company that is coming out of stealth, allows developers to use AI to simulate different user personas to test an app’s features and learn how to make their apps better.\nThe company was founded by Tom Charman and Olivia Higgs in 2024. Both have been serial entrepreneurs and worked on Startups together in areas includingtravelandlearning.\nTo date, the Startup has raised $7.5 million across two rounds. Its seed round of $5 million was led by MaC Venture Capital, with participation from people working at Discord, Google, Meta, Apple, Snapchat, and Pinterest. Blok’s pre-seed round was with Protagonist with participation from Rackhouse, Ryan Hoover’s Weekend Fund, and Blank Ventures.\nMarlon Nichols, managing GP at MaC Venture Capital, said that Blok is often compared to Optimizely and Amplitude, but those tools are more reactive. He said that Blok is edging them out by providing a predictive layer of testing for apps.\n“We backed Blok because we believe product development is at an inflection point. Teams are shipping faster than ever, but they’re still making critical decisions based on A/B tests and gut instinct. Blok’s simulation engine flips that model — giving teams the ability to predict user behavior before a single line of code is written,” he told TechCrunch over email.\nHiggs said that the need for testing is increasing as the complexity of interfaces has increased over time. She mentioned that they interviewed more than 100 product engineers to understand problems faced by product teams.\n“There is a real need for increased testing because the bar for visual interfaces is getting a lot higher. We’re seeing people interact with technology through chat, through voice. So if you’re introducing visual UI [elements] into the mix, you have to make sure that you are not introducing unnecessary friction into a user’s workflow,” she said.\nCharman said that both big and small companies face different problems. While small companies don’t have cohorts to test out their products and get live feedback, big companies want to avoid stuffing features into their apps and making them clunky.\n“We are trying to reach a place where companies don’t need to release their features on an experimental basis and wait for a few weeks or months for results to show up,” he said.\nWhen a customer starts working with Blok, they upload their event log data from Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Segment. Blok then performs behavioral modeling and creates different user personas for app makers to test. These personas would roughly cover most of an app’s user base.\nThen the development team submits a Figma design and experiment details — including the hypothesis they want to test and the user goal they want to achieve — to Blok, and the user persona agents then try to run the simulation many times. At the end, Blok will show insights about how users would use a particular feature and give recommendations.\nThese insights include an overall report of the experiment and details about what went well and what could be improved. Teams can also look at a persona-wise report and suggestions. Plus, because it is 2025, there is a chatbot that you can ask queries about your experiment.\nBlok has put its product behind a waitlist and is working with an initial set of customers, largely developing solutions in finance and healthcare. The Startup said these areas are ideal to target as they can’t put out bad experiments in public and play around with the product a lot.\nThe Startup charges companies through a SaaS model, but it is also figuring out how to balance out compute costs. The company is aiming to hit mid-single-digit millions in revenue this year and open up to more customers.\n\nTopics\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Since launching in late May, Almond’s blockchain-based optimization technology has powered over $2 million SGD in transfers through this corridor—delivering exchange rates consistently better than mid-market FX rates and unavailable elsewhere in the industry. These results reflect the same transformative impact that earned Almond consecutive industry recognition in 2023 and 2024.\n“This partnership represents a natural evolution in our mission to remove barriers in global financial transfers,” said Adam Swartzbaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of Almond FinTech. “We’ve always believed true innovation comes from deeply understanding customers’ needs and building solutions that not only solve today’s problems but anticipate tomorrow’s. In a crowded and commoditized space, Ample stands out for its commitment to leveraging technology to deliver meaningful value to its customers—making them an ideal partner for our expansion across Asia.”\nProven Performance Meets Regulatory Excellence\nAmple has been licensed as a Major Payment Institution by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for over 25 years, establishing its credibility as a trusted financial services provider. The partnership validates Almond’s ability to deliver superior performance while meeting Singapore’s regulatory requirements. Almond leverages a multitude of stablecoins as bridge assets to optimize cross-border treasury transfers between fiat currencies. Almond’s technology aggregates real-time market data to identify the most cost-effective and efficient transfer routes. This same breakthrough infrastructure is active across 10 countries and supports over 100 digital currencies.\nFor Ample, this enables:\nInnovation Leadership Drives Market Expansion\nThis partnership demonstrates Almond’s continued technology leadership in cross-border payments. The company’s consecutive CrossTech Innovation Awards underscore its role as an industry pioneer, consistently delivering solutions that address critical financial challenges globally.\n“Receiving this award is a testament to our team’s relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of financial technology,” said Swartzbaugh, referencing Almond’s recent recognition. “This partnership with Ample shows how award-winning innovation translates directly into enhanced services for financial institutions and their customers. One of our strongest value propositions is helping clients optimize across multiple stablecoins, not just one, enabling better liquidity, tighter spreads, and more flexibility without complicating onboarding.”\nEmbedded within Ample’s technology stack that powers their customer-facing and internal treasury operations, Almond’s technology enhances backend efficiency—delivering the same optimization capabilities that have positioned Almond as a leader in B2B cross-border payments.\nStrategic Growth in Southeast Asia\nThe partnership with Ample positions Almond FinTech for continued growth across Southeast Asian markets, where digital payment adoption creates opportunities for technological enhancement. This expansion reflects Almond’s strategy of partnering with established, regulated institutions to deliver cutting-edge payment solutions.\n“We believe that stablecoins are the future, and powering remittances with them is the way forward. Partnering with Almond has allowed us to harness that future safely, through a treasury layer that delivers faster, cheaper, and more reliable settlement.

But in asea of information, where should you turn for early insights?\nTwo powerful tools dominate the space:\nChatGPT (AI-powered research)\nX (real-time social sentiment)\nWhich one is better at spotting the next big altcoin trend before it hits the mainstream? Let’s break it down with real-world examples and use cases you can act on.\nIn crypto, narratives drive capital faster than fundamentals. Whether it’s restaking,Bitcoin layer-2sorDePIN, once the narrative catches fire, token prices often follow.\nExamples include:\n$HAWK soared to $500M+ after beingmemed by Haliey Welch, then dumped fast.\n$LIBRA, hyped by Argentina’s President Javier Milei, surged, then crashed in a matter of days.\nAI x Crypto agentslike Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol saw sharp interest due to the “AI + Token” fusion narrative.\nChatGPT is ideal for analyzing trends, comparing ecosystems and understanding the why behind each narrative.\nIts key strengths include:\nSummarizes VC flows, developer activity and user adoption.\nHelps you compare protocols and understand hype vs reality.\nGenerates strategic prompts, thesis frameworks and ecosystem maps.\nYou may use this prompt:\n“What is the most promising narrative in crypto for 2025 based on venture capital investment and ecosystem growth?”\nAs shown in the image below, according to ChatGPT, “Institutional Infrastructure & Exchanges” is the most important crypto narrative for 2025. This leads due to massive VC backing, like Binance’s $2 billion raise, and growing institutional demand for secure, compliant trading infrastructure.\nChatGPT is often misunderstood as simply a chatbot. In reality, traders can use it as an AI-powered research assistant, especially when paired with data from tools like L2BEAT, Artemis, Token Terminal and customGitHubscrapers.\nFor example, a trader might prompt ChatGPT to compare GitHub activity acrossmodular blockchain projects, cross-reference it withtotal value locked (TVL)and check if transaction fees are rising. Given that structure, ChatGPT summarizes insights that would otherwise take hours of manual browsing.\nSample workflow prompt:\n“Summarize the last 7 days of GitHub activity (commits, releases, key updates) for ZKsync and Starknet, and correlate that with recent trends in user adoption and protocol revenue using Artemis data. Keep the results short, clear, and easy to understand.”\nAccording to ChatGPT, as shown in the image below, ZKsync Era and Starknet ecosystems are showing steady developer activity with regular releases and commits. Additionally, Starknet leads in protocol revenue, posting $751,000 in gross profit with $127 million TVL, while ZKsync shows $600,000 total revenue since Q3 2024.\nX remains the fastest place to detect when something is catching fire, long before news sites or analysts write about it.\nIts key strengths include:\nLive tweets from developers, influencers and degens.\nReal-time buzz, memes and token spikes.\nRapid insights into sentiment shifts.\nSmarttradersmonitor X accounts like:\n@Dune — for weekly onchain metrics\n@cryptokoryo — for narrative alerts\n@punk9059 — for data-driven meme trends\nThe above screenshot shows a post from @Dune summarizing the top five onchain developments of the week in their “Dune Digest.” For traders, this is a valuable snapshot of real-time activity, highlighting trends like EulerSwap’s $300 million beta volume and KaiaChain adding native Tether USDt (USDT), which can signal growing ecosystems or upcoming narrative plays. Following such updates helps traders act early on protocols gaining traction before wider market attention.\nAdditionally, you may use X search filters like:\n(“stablecoin” OR “USDe” OR “Ethena” OR “GHO” OR “Mountain Protocol”) min_faves:50 lang:en since:2025-01-01\nThis is a special X search trick that helps you find popular tweets (50+ likes) about specific stablecoins like USDe, Ethena or GHO, posted in 2025 and in English. It’s useful for beginners because it filters out spam and shows you only the most talked-about posts, so you can spot which crypto projects are trending and why.\nBased on the above X search filter for trending stablecoin content, this tweet surfaced showing that Ethena’s USDe was gaining traction across Aave and Pendle (see image below), with over $2 billion in PT (Principal Token) locked. It highlights how USDe holders can stack multiple yield layers, offering valuable alpha for DeFi-focused traders.\nWhen comparing ChatGPT and X for identifying emerging crypto narratives, each serves a distinct purpose.ChatGPT excels at structured research, summarizing complex topics, comparing protocols and analyzing trends based on historical and broad-context data. It offers low-noise, logically organized insights, but may lack the most up-to-date information unless connected to live web tools.\nIn contrast, X provides real-time updates and social sentiment from developers, influencers and communities. It’s fast and dynamic, ideal for early signals but comes with high noise, misinformation risk and hype-driven content.\nFor strategic decision-making, ChatGPT helps validate and contextualize. For instant awareness and trend detection, X leads with speed. The best results often come from using both in tandem.\nExperienced crypto users often utilize both ChatGPT and X together, using ChatGPT for structured analysis and X for real-time updates, rather than relying on just one.\nSpot a buzzing trend on X:\nSee multiple tweets about “AI + Crypto wallets” or “restaking on Bitcoin.”\nValidate with ChatGPT:\nAsk, “What projects are building AI-integrated wallets, and are they gaining real traction?”\nAct with confidence:\nAllocate small capital to a promising token, monitor narrative momentum and track exit signals.\nMay be outdated if not browsing-enabled, especially in a fast-moving market like crypto.\nOutput depends on prompt quality; unclear queries can lead to vague or generic answers.\nCan miss emerging narratives that haven’t been widely documented yet.\nHigh chance of misinformation, hype or shilled tokens with no fundamentals.\nProne to herd behavior and echo chambers, especially during market volatility.\nDifficult for beginners to separate signal from noise, even with filters.\nUsing both tools with awareness of their limitations and backing insights with onchain or market data can help minimize risk while maximizing edge.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "加密貨幣交易員利用ChatGPT (AI-powered research)分析趨勢，並透過X (real-time social sentiment)掌握即時市場情緒，以利及早發現新興敘事(narrative)。ChatGPT擅長數據分析及趨勢比較，但資訊可能落後；X則提供即時動態，但雜訊及錯誤資訊較多。  最佳策略為結合兩者，利用ChatGPT驗證X上獲得的即時資訊，降低風險並提升獲利機會。  此方法適用於追蹤DePINs、RWAs等新興加密貨幣趨勢。及早發現，方能搶佔先機。\n", "summary": "加密貨幣交易員利用ChatGPT (AI-powered research)分析趨勢，並透過X (real-time social sentiment)掌握即時市場情緒，以利及早發現新興敘事(narrative)。ChatGPT擅長數據分析及趨勢比較，但資訊可能落後；X則提供即時動態，但雜訊及錯誤資訊較多。  最佳策略為結合兩者，利用ChatGPT驗證X上獲得的即時資訊，降低風險並提升獲利機會。  此方法適用於追蹤DePINs、RWAs等新興加密貨幣趨勢。及早發現，方能搶佔先機。"}

The report comes asSingaporecelebrates its 60th year of independence.\nKey recommendations include the development of a centralised directory of API access points across major banks, more uniform onboarding requirements and the creation of collaborative sandboxes that would enable fintechs to test integrations in a risk-controlled environment.\nThe report also urges regulators to strengthen API-related guidelines to reduce subjectivity in how banks engage with third-party fintechs and to promote a more inclusive digital finance ecosystem.\nWhile Singapore has made significant strides in promoting financial innovation over the past decade, Fintech Nation said there is still ‘room for improvement’ in fostering openness between incumbents and newer players in the SME space.\nIn the foreword, Fintech Nation Think Tank co-foundersShadab TaiyabiandVarun Mittalwrite: “Much like a restaurant menu, a well-defined API clearly outlines the available data to different apps, ensuring everyone gets what they need to deliver innovative services. The benefits of a level playing field extend far beyond just fostering competition.\n“It encourages specialisation and collaboration, allowing companies to focus on their core competencies and integrate seamlessly with other providers. This creates a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem, ultimately benefiting consumers with more choices and better experiences.”\nFintech Nation said it will continue working with ecosystem stakeholders to drive forward practical reforms and help shape a more connected, competitive SME banking environment.\nThe Fintech Times\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "新加坡金融科技公司呼籲公平開放銀行應用程式介面 (API) 存取權，以解決中小企業銀行業務的困境。報告指出，中小企業金融科技公司在與傳統銀行整合時處於劣勢，並建議建立API存取點集中目錄、統一的加入流程及合作沙盒 (sandbox) 等措施，以促進公平競爭及創新。報告也促請監管機構強化API相關指引，減少銀行與第三方金融科技公司合作的主觀性。此報告凸顯API標準化及監管協調的重要性，有助於打造更具包容性的數位金融生態系統。\n", "summary": "新加坡金融科技公司呼籲公平開放銀行應用程式介面 (API) 存取權，以解決中小企業銀行業務的困境。報告指出，中小企業金融科技公司在與傳統銀行整合時處於劣勢，並建議建立API存取點集中目錄、統一的加入流程及合作沙盒 (sandbox) 等措施，以促進公平競爭及創新。報告也促請監管機構強化API相關指引，減少銀行與第三方金融科技公司合作的主觀性。此報告凸顯API標準化及監管協調的重要性，有助於打造更具包容性的數位金融生態系統。"}

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\nToday in crypto, GMX has paused trading after a liquidity pool exploit drained over $40 million. Bybit has confirmed details of the upcoming Pump.fun token sale, and the US has sanctioned a North Korean IT worker ring accused of targeting American companies.\nThe GMX protocolhalted trading on GMX V1after a liquidity pool suffered an exploit on Wednesday, leading to $40 million in funds being stolen and sent to an unknown wallet.\nGMX V1 is the first version of the GMX perpetual exchange deployed on the Arbitrum network. The attacked pool is a liquidity provider for the GMX protocol with a basket of underlying digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and stablecoins,accordingto the GMX team.\nThe protocol has also announced a temporary suspension in minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both Arbitrum and the layer-1 Avalanche network to protect against any additional fallout from the cybersecurity exploit.\nUsers of the platform wereinstructedto disable leverage and change their settings to disable GLP minting.\nBlockchain security company SlowMistattributedthe exploit to a design flaw that allowed hackers to manipulate the GLP token price through the calculation of the total assets under management.\nBybit has confirmeddetails of the much-awaited Pump.fun token sale, revealing that users registered through its European Union-regulated platform, Bybit.eu, will not be able to participate, citing compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nThe public sale of PUMP, the native token of the no-code memecoin launchpad Pump.fun, will open on Saturday at 14:00 UTC and run through Tuesday, according to a Wednesday press release shared with Cointelegraph.A total of 150 billion PUMP tokens, 15% of the 1 trillion total supply, will be offered at a fixed price of $0.004 USDT per token.\nBybit, currently the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is the only major platform participating in the sale, the announcement said. A number of other exchanges will also support the token sale.\nBybit will support subscriptions in USDt (USDT), USDC (USDC), Solana (SOL) and bbSOL, providing access to both stablecoins and Solana-native assets.\nBybit has become the second major crypto exchange to reveal details about the upcoming PUMP token sale, following a slip by Gate.io. On Tuesday, Gate.io briefly published apage outlining a $600 million PUMP token sale, which was quickly taken down.\nIn a Wednesday post on X shortly after the sale was revealed by Bybit, Pump.fun officially announced the token sale. “Our plan is to Kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the platformwrote.\nPump.fun, launched in January 2024, quickly rose to prominence for enabling users to create and trade memecoins with zero coding skills. The platform’s gamified interface and viral mechanics have driven a wave of onchain experimentation on Solana, transforming casual users into active token creators and traders.\nThe US Treasury on Tuesday sanctioned two people, a North Korean and Russian man, along with four entities involved in what it says was a North Korea-run IT worker ring that infiltrates US crypto companies aiming to exploit them.\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) slapped sanctions on the North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for allegedly stealing US citizens’ information to use as aliases and giving the information to hired foreign IT workers who would seek employment at US companies.\nOFAC also sanctioned the Russian national Gayk Asatryan for allegedly using his four Russia-based companies to employ dozens of North Korean IT workers. OFAC said North Korea aims to bankroll its missile programs by deploying a thousands-strong workforce of highly skilled IT workers all over the world.\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender.\nNorth Korea has been notorious for its high-profile hacks such as the $1.5 billion exploit against crypto exchange Bybit exploit in February, but TRM Labs said the nation is starting to shift to “deception-based revenue generation, including IT worker infiltration.”\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "GMX V1 (GMX 版本一) 遭漏洞攻擊，導致逾 4000 萬美元資產被盜，並已暫停交易及 GLP 代幣的鑄造和贖回。Bybit 確認將進行 Pump.fun 代幣銷售，但歐盟地區用戶因 MiCA 法規而無法參與。美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的 IT 工作者網絡，該網絡涉嫌針對美國公司進行網路攻擊。Pump.fun 平台旨在透過零程式碼功能創造和交易迷因幣。北韓利用此網絡從事資產竊取活動，為其飛彈計畫籌集資金。\n", "summary": "GMX V1 (GMX 版本一) 遭漏洞攻擊，導致逾 4000 萬美元資產被盜，並已暫停交易及 GLP 代幣的鑄造和贖回。Bybit 確認將進行 Pump.fun 代幣銷售，但歐盟地區用戶因 MiCA 法規而無法參與。美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的 IT 工作者網絡，該網絡涉嫌針對美國公司進行網路攻擊。Pump.fun 平台旨在透過零程式碼功能創造和交易迷因幣。北韓利用此網絡從事資產竊取活動，為其飛彈計畫籌集資金。"}

Make sure the summary is useful and meaningful for internal teams, focusing on the most relevant information.\n\n\nInput:\nTitle: ChatGPT vs X: Which is better at first spotting the next big crypto narrative?\nArticle Content: Crypto traders use ChatGPT and X to catch early signals, combining AI-driven analysis with real-time sentiment. But each comes with its risks.\nChatGPT is ideal for comparing protocols, understanding trends and filtering out noise for research-based decisions.\nX provides real-time sentiment and early signals, making it useful for catching trending narratives before they hit mainstream news.\nEach tool has risks: ChatGPT can be outdated without live data, while X carries high noise and misinformation risk.\nCombining both tools gives traders the best edge, enabling them to validate real-time hype with data-backed insights.\nIn crypto, timing is everything. Spotting the next big crypto narrative, whether restaking, DePINs or RWAs, can put savvy traders miles ahead of the crowd. But in asea of information, where should you turn for early insights?\nTwo powerful tools dominate the space:\nChatGPT (AI-powered research)\nX (real-time social sentiment)\nWhich one is better at spotting the next big altcoin trend before it hits the mainstream? Let’s break it down with real-world examples and use cases you can act on.\nIn crypto, narratives drive capital faster than fundamentals. Whether it’s restaking,Bitcoin layer-2sorDePIN, once the narrative catches fire, token prices often follow.\nExamples include:\n$HAWK soared to $500M+ after beingmemed by Haliey Welch, then dumped fast.\n$LIBRA, hyped by Argentina’s President Javier Milei, surged, then crashed in a matter of days.\nAI x Crypto agentslike Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol saw sharp interest due to the “AI + Token” fusion narrative.\nChatGPT is ideal for analyzing trends, comparing ecosystems and understanding the why behind each narrative.\nIts key strengths include:\nSummarizes VC flows, developer activity and user adoption.\nHelps you compare protocols and understand hype vs reality.\nGenerates strategic prompts, thesis frameworks and ecosystem maps.\nYou may use this prompt:\n“What is the most promising narrative in crypto for 2025 based on venture capital investment and ecosystem growth?”\nAs shown in the image below, according to ChatGPT, “Institutional Infrastructure & Exchanges” is the most important crypto narrative for 2025. This leads due to massive VC backing, like Binance’s $2 billion raise, and growing institutional demand for secure, compliant trading infrastructure.\nChatGPT is often misunderstood as simply a chatbot. In reality, traders can use it as an AI-powered research assistant, especially when paired with data from tools like L2BEAT, Artemis, Token Terminal and customGitHubscrapers.\nFor example, a trader might prompt ChatGPT to compare GitHub activity acrossmodular blockchain projects, cross-reference it withtotal value locked (TVL)and check if transaction fees are rising. Given that structure, ChatGPT summarizes insights that would otherwise take hours of manual browsing.\nSample workflow prompt:\n“Summarize the last 7 days of GitHub activity (commits, releases, key updates) for ZKsync and Starknet, and correlate that with recent trends in user adoption and protocol revenue using Artemis data. Keep the results short, clear, and easy to understand.”\nAccording to ChatGPT, as shown in the image below, ZKsync Era and Starknet ecosystems are showing steady developer activity with regular releases and commits. Additionally, Starknet leads in protocol revenue, posting $751,000 in gross profit with $127 million TVL, while ZKsync shows $600,000 total revenue since Q3 2024.\nX remains the fastest place to detect when something is catching fire, long before news sites or analysts write about it.\nIts key strengths include:\nLive tweets from developers, influencers and degens.\nReal-time buzz, memes and token spikes.\nRapid insights into sentiment shifts.\nSmarttradersmonitor X accounts like:\n@Dune — for weekly onchain metrics\n@cryptokoryo — for narrative alerts\n@punk9059 — for data-driven meme trends\nThe above screenshot shows a post from @Dune summarizing the top five onchain developments of the week in their “Dune Digest.” For traders, this is a valuable snapshot of real-time activity, highlighting trends like EulerSwap’s $300 million beta volume and KaiaChain adding native Tether USDt (USDT), which can signal growing ecosystems or upcoming narrative plays. Following such updates helps traders act early on protocols gaining traction before wider market attention.\nAdditionally, you may use X search filters like:\n(“stablecoin” OR “USDe” OR “Ethena” OR “GHO” OR “Mountain Protocol”) min_faves:50 lang:en since:2025-01-01\nThis is a special X search trick that helps you find popular tweets (50+ likes) about specific stablecoins like USDe, Ethena or GHO, posted in 2025 and in English. It’s useful for beginners because it filters out spam and shows you only the most talked-about posts, so you can spot which crypto projects are trending and why.\nBased on the above X search filter for trending stablecoin content, this tweet surfaced showing that Ethena’s USDe was gaining traction across Aave and Pendle (see image below), with over $2 billion in PT (Principal Token) locked. It highlights how USDe holders can stack multiple yield layers, offering valuable alpha for DeFi-focused traders.\nWhen comparing ChatGPT and X for identifying emerging crypto narratives, each serves a distinct purpose.ChatGPT excels at structured research, summarizing complex topics, comparing protocols and analyzing trends based on historical and broad-context data. It offers low-noise, logically organized insights, but may lack the most up-to-date information unless connected to live web tools.\nIn contrast, X provides real-time updates and social sentiment from developers, influencers and communities. It’s fast and dynamic, ideal for early signals but comes with high noise, misinformation risk and hype-driven content.\nFor strategic decision-making, ChatGPT helps validate and contextualize. For instant awareness and trend detection, X leads with speed. The best results often come from using both in tandem.\nExperienced crypto users often utilize both ChatGPT and X together, using ChatGPT for structured analysis and X for real-time updates, rather than relying on just one.\nSpot a buzzing trend on X:\nSee multiple tweets about “AI + Crypto wallets” or “restaking on Bitcoin.”\nValidate with ChatGPT:\nAsk, “What projects are building AI-integrated wallets, and are they gaining real traction?”\nAct with confidence:\nAllocate small capital to a promising token, monitor narrative momentum and track exit signals.\nMay be outdated if not browsing-enabled, especially in a fast-moving market like crypto.\nOutput depends on prompt quality; unclear queries can lead to vague or generic answers.\nCan miss emerging narratives that haven’t been widely documented yet.\nHigh chance of misinformation, hype or shilled tokens with no fundamentals.\nProne to herd behavior and echo chambers, especially during market volatility.\nDifficult for beginners to separate signal from noise, even with filters.\nUsing both tools with awareness of their limitations and backing insights with onchain or market data can help minimize risk while maximizing edge.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "加密貨幣交易者利用ChatGPT(AI-powered research)和X(real-time social sentiment)平台捕捉早期訊號。ChatGPT擅長趨勢分析及數據比對，提供深入研究；X則即時反映市場情緒，利於快速掌握熱門話題。然ChatGPT資料可能過時，X則充斥噪音與假訊息。最佳策略為整合兩者，利用ChatGPT驗證X平台上獲得的即時資訊，降低風險並提高效率。  此方法有助於及早發現新興加密貨幣敘事(narrative)，例如近期AI結合加密貨幣錢包的趨勢。\n", "summary": "加密貨幣交易者利用ChatGPT(AI-powered research)和X(real-time social sentiment)平台捕捉早期訊號。ChatGPT擅長趨勢分析及數據比對，提供深入研究；X則即時反映市場情緒，利於快速掌握熱門話題。然ChatGPT資料可能過時，X則充斥噪音與假訊息。最佳策略為整合兩者，利用ChatGPT驗證X平台上獲得的即時資訊，降低風險並提高效率。  此方法有助於及早發現新興加密貨幣敘事(narrative)，例如近期AI結合加密貨幣錢包的趨勢。"}

From AI chips and high-speed memory to edge computing technologies, PCDA builds upstream design capabilities essential for global semiconductor leadership, Invest Penang noted in a statement.\nThe company said that with a bold mission to train over 1,000 IC design engineers within five years, the academy reinforces Penang’s emergence as a Southeast Asian IC design epicentre — and affirms Malaysia’s readiness to lead next-generation chip innovation on the global stage.\nIt added that PCDA is one of three strategic pillars under the Penang Silicon Design @5KM+ initiative, led by the company to build a tightly integrated front-end innovation ecosystem. The initiative supports Malaysia’s broader ambition to become a regional leader in upstream semiconductor capabilities — in full alignment with the National Semiconductor Strategy (NSS) and the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030).\nSpearheaded in partnership with the Penang Skills Development Centre (PSDC), PCDA is built on a strong government–industry–academia collaboration model. Its training programmes are designed by industry, for industry, and focus on four core IC design disciplines: physical design, design verification, custom layout, and analogue design. The courses target both fresh graduates and existing engineers, offering a suite of intensive four- to nine-week IC Design Mastery Courses.\nAccording to Invest Penang, these courses are delivered by seasoned experts with more than two decades of hands-on experience in global semiconductor companies, ensuring real-world relevance and immediate applicability in high-impact roles. The first cohort began training on 16 June 2025.\nIn response to growing industry demand for next-generation chip innovation, the academy will also offer advanced upskilling in critical technologies shaping tomorrow’s semiconductor landscape. Its training modules cover high-speed interconnects such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express and Compute Express Link, as well as key memory technologies including double data rate and high-bandwidth memory. Additional future-tech modules — including advanced packaging, AI software, and emulation — will equip engineers to navigate complex design cycles, optimise system-level performance, and contribute to the development of Malaysia’s own chip architectures for global markets.\n“The opening of the Penang Chip Design Academy is a strategic leap forward in Malaysia’s semiconductor ambition. It sends a strong signal to global investors that Penang is not only home to world-class manufacturing, but is fast becoming a hub for front-end IC design innovation — powered by a highly skilled, AI-ready local talent pool,” said Chow Kon Yeow, chief minister of Penang, who officiated the launch.\nHe added, “This is how we begin realising our vision of ‘made-by-Malaysia’ chips — designed, developed, and driven by Penang talent for the world.”\nLooking ahead, PCDA is poised to power the next phase of Penang’s semiconductor leadership by producing a robust, AI-ready talent pipeline. This will directly support the growth of IC design companies and catalyse Malaysia’s ambition to become a global player in high-value chip development — from design to deployment.\nFor more technology news and the latest updates, follow us onFacebook,TwitterorLinkedIn\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "檳城推出檳城晶片設計學院 (Penang Chip Design Academy, PCDA)，目標五年內培訓逾千名積體電路 (IC) 設計工程師。學院課程涵蓋物理設計、驗證、客製佈局及類比設計等，並包含AI晶片及高速記憶體等新興技術。此舉旨在提升馬來西亞半導體設計能力，符合國家半導體策略 (NSS) 及2030年新工業總體規劃 (NIMP 2030) 的目標，並促進「馬來西亞製造」晶片的願景。首期課程於2025年6月16日開課。PCDA將成為檳城半導體產業發展的重要引擎。\n", "summary": "檳城推出檳城晶片設計學院 (Penang Chip Design Academy, PCDA)，目標五年內培訓逾千名積體電路 (IC) 設計工程師。學院課程涵蓋物理設計、驗證、客製佈局及類比設計等，並包含AI晶片及高速記憶體等新興技術。此舉旨在提升馬來西亞半導體設計能力，符合國家半導體策略 (NSS) 及2030年新工業總體規劃 (NIMP 2030) 的目標，並促進「馬來西亞製造」晶片的願景。首期課程於2025年6月16日開課。PCDA將成為檳城半導體產業發展的重要引擎。"}

Bybit has confirmed details of the upcoming Pump.fun token sale, and the US has sanctioned a North Korean IT worker ring accused of targeting American companies.\nThe GMX protocolhalted trading on GMX V1after a liquidity pool suffered an exploit on Wednesday, leading to $40 million in funds being stolen and sent to an unknown wallet.\nGMX V1 is the first version of the GMX perpetual exchange deployed on the Arbitrum network. The attacked pool is a liquidity provider for the GMX protocol with a basket of underlying digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and stablecoins,accordingto the GMX team.\nThe protocol has also announced a temporary suspension in minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both Arbitrum and the layer-1 Avalanche network to protect against any additional fallout from the cybersecurity exploit.\nUsers of the platform wereinstructedto disable leverage and change their settings to disable GLP minting.\nBlockchain security company SlowMistattributedthe exploit to a design flaw that allowed hackers to manipulate the GLP token price through the calculation of the total assets under management.\nBybit has confirmeddetails of the much-awaited Pump.fun token sale, revealing that users registered through its European Union-regulated platform, Bybit.eu, will not be able to participate, citing compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nThe public sale of PUMP, the native token of the no-code memecoin launchpad Pump.fun, will open on Saturday at 14:00 UTC and run through Tuesday, according to a Wednesday press release shared with Cointelegraph.A total of 150 billion PUMP tokens, 15% of the 1 trillion total supply, will be offered at a fixed price of $0.004 USDT per token.\nBybit, currently the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is the only major platform participating in the sale, the announcement said. A number of other exchanges will also support the token sale.\nBybit will support subscriptions in USDt (USDT), USDC (USDC), Solana (SOL) and bbSOL, providing access to both stablecoins and Solana-native assets.\nBybit has become the second major crypto exchange to reveal details about the upcoming PUMP token sale, following a slip by Gate.io. On Tuesday, Gate.io briefly published apage outlining a $600 million PUMP token sale, which was quickly taken down.\nIn a Wednesday post on X shortly after the sale was revealed by Bybit, Pump.fun officially announced the token sale. “Our plan is to Kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the platformwrote.\nPump.fun, launched in January 2024, quickly rose to prominence for enabling users to create and trade memecoins with zero coding skills. The platform’s gamified interface and viral mechanics have driven a wave of onchain experimentation on Solana, transforming casual users into active token creators and traders.\nThe US Treasury on Tuesday sanctioned two people, a North Korean and Russian man, along with four entities involved in what it says was a North Korea-run IT worker ring that infiltrates US crypto companies aiming to exploit them.\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) slapped sanctions on the North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for allegedly stealing US citizens’ information to use as aliases and giving the information to hired foreign IT workers who would seek employment at US companies.\nOFAC also sanctioned the Russian national Gayk Asatryan for allegedly using his four Russia-based companies to employ dozens of North Korean IT workers. OFAC said North Korea aims to bankroll its missile programs by deploying a thousands-strong workforce of highly skilled IT workers all over the world.\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender.\nNorth Korea has been notorious for its high-profile hacks such as the $1.5 billion exploit against crypto exchange Bybit exploit in February, but TRM Labs said the nation is starting to shift to “deception-based revenue generation, including IT worker infiltration.”\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "GMX V1 (GMX 版本一)平台遭漏洞攻擊，損失逾4000萬美元資產；Bybit 證實將參與Pump.fun代幣銷售 (token sale)，但歐盟用戶因MiCA法規無法參與；美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的IT工作者組織，該組織涉嫌針對美國公司進行網路攻擊；該組織利用竊取的美國公民身份信息，雇傭外國IT工作者滲透美國公司；北韓試圖藉此資助其飛彈計畫。\n", "summary": "GMX V1 (GMX 版本一)平台遭漏洞攻擊，損失逾4000萬美元資產；Bybit 證實將參與Pump.fun代幣銷售 (token sale)，但歐盟用戶因MiCA法規無法參與；美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的IT工作者組織，該組織涉嫌針對美國公司進行網路攻擊；該組織利用竊取的美國公民身份信息，雇傭外國IT工作者滲透美國公司；北韓試圖藉此資助其飛彈計畫。"}

In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social network, X, whichwas recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also putGrok’s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.\nIntroducing Grok 4, the world's most powerful AI model. Watch the livestream now:https://t.co/59iDX5s2ck\nThe expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model,GPT-5,which is expected to launch later this summer.\n“With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. “At times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.”\nThe launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. Earlier on Wednesday,Linda Yaccarino stepped downfrom her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.\nYaccarino’s departure comes just days after Grok’s official, automated X account responded to users withantisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler.xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to haveremoved a recently added section from Grok’s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow, that told it not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims.\nMusk and xAI’s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4’s performance and capabilities.\nxAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work “like a study group” to find the best answer.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 shows frontier level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last Exam— a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity’s Last Exam without “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with “tools,” was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.\nThe nonprofit Arc Prize says thatGrok achieves a new state-of-the-art scoreon its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. That’s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.\nAlongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.\nSuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October.\nxAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.\nDespite Grok’s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Since launching in late May, Almond’s blockchain-based optimization technology has powered over $2 million SGD in transfers through this corridor—delivering exchange rates consistently better than mid-market FX rates and unavailable elsewhere in the industry. These results reflect the same transformative impact that earned Almond consecutive industry recognition in 2023 and 2024.\n“This partnership represents a natural evolution in our mission to remove barriers in global financial transfers,” said Adam Swartzbaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of Almond FinTech. “We’ve always believed true innovation comes from deeply understanding customers’ needs and building solutions that not only solve today’s problems but anticipate tomorrow’s. In a crowded and commoditized space, Ample stands out for its commitment to leveraging technology to deliver meaningful value to its customers—making them an ideal partner for our expansion across Asia.”\nProven Performance Meets Regulatory Excellence\nAmple has been licensed as a Major Payment Institution by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for over 25 years, establishing its credibility as a trusted financial services provider. The partnership validates Almond’s ability to deliver superior performance while meeting Singapore’s regulatory requirements. Almond leverages a multitude of stablecoins as bridge assets to optimize cross-border treasury transfers between fiat currencies. Almond’s technology aggregates real-time market data to identify the most cost-effective and efficient transfer routes. This same breakthrough infrastructure is active across 10 countries and supports over 100 digital currencies.\nFor Ample, this enables:\nInnovation Leadership Drives Market Expansion\nThis partnership demonstrates Almond’s continued technology leadership in cross-border payments. The company’s consecutive CrossTech Innovation Awards underscore its role as an industry pioneer, consistently delivering solutions that address critical financial challenges globally.\n“Receiving this award is a testament to our team’s relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of financial technology,” said Swartzbaugh, referencing Almond’s recent recognition. “This partnership with Ample shows how award-winning innovation translates directly into enhanced services for financial institutions and their customers. One of our strongest value propositions is helping clients optimize across multiple stablecoins, not just one, enabling better liquidity, tighter spreads, and more flexibility without complicating onboarding.”\nEmbedded within Ample’s technology stack that powers their customer-facing and internal treasury operations, Almond’s technology enhances backend efficiency—delivering the same optimization capabilities that have positioned Almond as a leader in B2B cross-border payments.\nStrategic Growth in Southeast Asia\nThe partnership with Ample positions Almond FinTech for continued growth across Southeast Asian markets, where digital payment adoption creates opportunities for technological enhancement. This expansion reflects Almond’s strategy of partnering with established, regulated institutions to deliver cutting-edge payment solutions.\n“We believe that stablecoins are the future, and powering remittances with them is the way forward. Partnering with Almond has allowed us to harness that future safely, through a treasury layer that delivers faster, cheaper, and more reliable settlement. For our customers, nothing changes on the surface—but under the hood, we’re moving with the times.” — Matthew Yap, CEO, Ample Transfers.\n\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "杏仁金融科技公司 (Almond FinTech) 宣布與新加坡匯款業者 Ample Transfers 合作，運用其專利區塊鏈技術 (blockchain) 優化新加坡至印尼的資金結算作業。此合作已處理超過200萬新加坡元轉帳，匯率優於市場中間價。此舉展現杏仁金融科技拓展東南亞跨境支付市場的策略，並驗證其技術符合新加坡監管要求，有助於提升跨境支付效率。  Ample Transfers 使用 Almond 的技術來優化其內部資金管理和結算流程。此合作鞏固了 Almond 在 B2B 跨境支付領域的領導地位。\n", "summary": "杏仁金融科技公司 (Almond FinTech) 宣布與新加坡匯款業者 Ample Transfers 合作，運用其專利區塊鏈技術 (blockchain) 優化新加坡至印尼的資金結算作業。此合作已處理超過200萬新加坡元轉帳，匯率優於市場中間價。此舉展現杏仁金融科技拓展東南亞跨境支付市場的策略，並驗證其技術符合新加坡監管要求，有助於提升跨境支付效率。  Ample Transfers 使用 Almond 的技術來優化其內部資金管理和結算流程。此合作鞏固了 Almond 在 B2B 跨境支付領域的領導地位。"}

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\nToday in crypto, GMX has paused trading after a liquidity pool exploit drained over $40 million. Bybit has confirmed details of the upcoming Pump.fun token sale, and the US has sanctioned a North Korean IT worker ring accused of targeting American companies.\nThe GMX protocolhalted trading on GMX V1after a liquidity pool suffered an exploit on Wednesday, leading to $40 million in funds being stolen and sent to an unknown wallet.\nGMX V1 is the first version of the GMX perpetual exchange deployed on the Arbitrum network. The attacked pool is a liquidity provider for the GMX protocol with a basket of underlying digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and stablecoins,accordingto the GMX team.\nThe protocol has also announced a temporary suspension in minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both Arbitrum and the layer-1 Avalanche network to protect against any additional fallout from the cybersecurity exploit.\nUsers of the platform wereinstructedto disable leverage and change their settings to disable GLP minting.\nBlockchain security company SlowMistattributedthe exploit to a design flaw that allowed hackers to manipulate the GLP token price through the calculation of the total assets under management.\nBybit has confirmeddetails of the much-awaited Pump.fun token sale, revealing that users registered through its European Union-regulated platform, Bybit.eu, will not be able to participate, citing compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nThe public sale of PUMP, the native token of the no-code memecoin launchpad Pump.fun, will open on Saturday at 14:00 UTC and run through Tuesday, according to a Wednesday press release shared with Cointelegraph.A total of 150 billion PUMP tokens, 15% of the 1 trillion total supply, will be offered at a fixed price of $0.004 USDT per token.\nBybit, currently the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is the only major platform participating in the sale, the announcement said. A number of other exchanges will also support the token sale.\nBybit will support subscriptions in USDt (USDT), USDC (USDC), Solana (SOL) and bbSOL, providing access to both stablecoins and Solana-native assets.\nBybit has become the second major crypto exchange to reveal details about the upcoming PUMP token sale, following a slip by Gate.io. On Tuesday, Gate.io briefly published apage outlining a $600 million PUMP token sale, which was quickly taken down.\nIn a Wednesday post on X shortly after the sale was revealed by Bybit, Pump.fun officially announced the token sale. “Our plan is to Kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the platformwrote.\nPump.fun, launched in January 2024, quickly rose to prominence for enabling users to create and trade memecoins with zero coding skills. The platform’s gamified interface and viral mechanics have driven a wave of onchain experimentation on Solana, transforming casual users into active token creators and traders.\nThe US Treasury on Tuesday sanctioned two people, a North Korean and Russian man, along with four entities involved in what it says was a North Korea-run IT worker ring that infiltrates US crypto companies aiming to exploit them.\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) slapped sanctions on the North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for allegedly stealing US citizens’ information to use as aliases and giving the information to hired foreign IT workers who would seek employment at US companies.\nOFAC also sanctioned the Russian national Gayk Asatryan for allegedly using his four Russia-based companies to employ dozens of North Korean IT workers. OFAC said North Korea aims to bankroll its missile programs by deploying a thousands-strong workforce of highly skilled IT workers all over the world.\n“Treasury remains committed to using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime’s efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender.\nNorth Korea has been notorious for its high-profile hacks such as the $1.5 billion exploit against crypto exchange Bybit exploit in February, but TRM Labs said the nation is starting to shift to “deception-based revenue generation, including IT worker infiltration.”\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "GMX V1 (GMX 版本一) 遭資安漏洞攻擊，導致逾 4000 萬美元資金被盜。Bybit 確認將進行 Pump.fun 代幣銷售，但歐盟用戶因 MiCA 法規無法參與。美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的 IT 工作者組織，該組織涉嫌鎖定美國公司進行網路攻擊，企圖竊取資金以資助飛彈計畫。  Pump.fun 平台允許用戶無需編碼技能即可創建和交易迷因幣 (memecoins)。北韓駭客近年來轉向以欺騙性手段獲利，例如滲透 IT 行業。\n", "summary": "GMX V1 (GMX 版本一) 遭資安漏洞攻擊，導致逾 4000 萬美元資金被盜。Bybit 確認將進行 Pump.fun 代幣銷售，但歐盟用戶因 MiCA 法規無法參與。美國財政部制裁一個由北韓主導的 IT 工作者組織，該組織涉嫌鎖定美國公司進行網路攻擊，企圖竊取資金以資助飛彈計畫。  Pump.fun 平台允許用戶無需編碼技能即可創建和交易迷因幣 (memecoins)。北韓駭客近年來轉向以欺騙性手段獲利，例如滲透 IT 行業。"}

In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social network, X, whichwas recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also putGrok’s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.\nIntroducing Grok 4, the world's most powerful AI model. Watch the livestream now:https://t.co/59iDX5s2ck\nThe expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model,GPT-5,which is expected to launch later this summer.\n“With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. “At times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.”\nThe launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. Earlier on Wednesday,Linda Yaccarino stepped downfrom her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.\nYaccarino’s departure comes just days after Grok’s official, automated X account responded to users withantisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler.xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to haveremoved a recently added section from Grok’s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow, that told it not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims.\nMusk and xAI’s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4’s performance and capabilities.\nxAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work “like a study group” to find the best answer.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 shows frontier level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last Exam— a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity’s Last Exam without “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with “tools,” was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.\nThe nonprofit Arc Prize says thatGrok achieves a new state-of-the-art scoreon its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. That’s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.\nAlongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.\nSuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October.\nxAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.\nDespite Grok’s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Since launching in late May, Almond’s blockchain-based optimization technology has powered over $2 million SGD in transfers through this corridor—delivering exchange rates consistently better than mid-market FX rates and unavailable elsewhere in the industry. These results reflect the same transformative impact that earned Almond consecutive industry recognition in 2023 and 2024.\n“This partnership represents a natural evolution in our mission to remove barriers in global financial transfers,” said Adam Swartzbaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of Almond FinTech. “We’ve always believed true innovation comes from deeply understanding customers’ needs and building solutions that not only solve today’s problems but anticipate tomorrow’s. In a crowded and commoditized space, Ample stands out for its commitment to leveraging technology to deliver meaningful value to its customers—making them an ideal partner for our expansion across Asia.”\nProven Performance Meets Regulatory Excellence\nAmple has been licensed as a Major Payment Institution by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for over 25 years, establishing its credibility as a trusted financial services provider. The partnership validates Almond’s ability to deliver superior performance while meeting Singapore’s regulatory requirements. Almond leverages a multitude of stablecoins as bridge assets to optimize cross-border treasury transfers between fiat currencies. Almond’s technology aggregates real-time market data to identify the most cost-effective and efficient transfer routes. This same breakthrough infrastructure is active across 10 countries and supports over 100 digital currencies.\nFor Ample, this enables:\nInnovation Leadership Drives Market Expansion\nThis partnership demonstrates Almond’s continued technology leadership in cross-border payments. The company’s consecutive CrossTech Innovation Awards underscore its role as an industry pioneer, consistently delivering solutions that address critical financial challenges globally.\n“Receiving this award is a testament to our team’s relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of financial technology,” said Swartzbaugh, referencing Almond’s recent recognition. “This partnership with Ample shows how award-winning innovation translates directly into enhanced services for financial institutions and their customers. One of our strongest value propositions is helping clients optimize across multiple stablecoins, not just one, enabling better liquidity, tighter spreads, and more flexibility without complicating onboarding.”\nEmbedded within Ample’s technology stack that powers their customer-facing and internal treasury operations, Almond’s technology enhances backend efficiency—delivering the same optimization capabilities that have positioned Almond as a leader in B2B cross-border payments.\nStrategic Growth in Southeast Asia\nThe partnership with Ample positions Almond FinTech for continued growth across Southeast Asian markets, where digital payment adoption creates opportunities for technological enhancement. This expansion reflects Almond’s strategy of partnering with established, regulated institutions to deliver cutting-edge payment solutions.\n“We believe that stablecoins are the future, and powering remittances with them is the way forward. Partnering with Almond has allowed us to harness that future safely, through a treasury layer that delivers faster, cheaper, and more reliable settlement. For our customers, nothing changes on the surface—but under the hood, we’re moving with the times.” — Matthew Yap, CEO, Ample Transfers.\n\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "杏仁金融科技 (Almond FinTech) 與新加坡匯款業者 Ample Transfers 合作，運用區塊鏈 (blockchain) 技術優化新加坡至印尼的資金轉帳作業。此合作已處理超過 200 萬新元轉帳，匯率優於市場中間價。此舉展現杏仁金融科技在亞太區跨境支付領域的擴張策略，並憑藉其屢獲殊榮的技術，提升 Ample Transfers 的內部效率及客戶服務。此合作強化杏仁金融科技於東南亞市場的拓展，並驗證其技術符合新加坡監管要求。  透過多元穩定幣 (stablecoins) 優化跨境支付，展現其技術領先地位。\n", "summary": "杏仁金融科技 (Almond FinTech) 與新加坡匯款業者 Ample Transfers 合作，運用區塊鏈 (blockchain) 技術優化新加坡至印尼的資金轉帳作業。此合作已處理超過 200 萬新元轉帳，匯率優於市場中間價。此舉展現杏仁金融科技在亞太區跨境支付領域的擴張策略，並憑藉其屢獲殊榮的技術，提升 Ample Transfers 的內部效率及客戶服務。此合作強化杏仁金融科技於東南亞市場的拓展，並驗證其技術符合新加坡監管要求。  透過多元穩定幣 (stablecoins) 優化跨境支付，展現其技術領先地位。"}

In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social network, X, whichwas recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also putGrok’s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.\nIntroducing Grok 4, the world's most powerful AI model. Watch the livestream now:https://t.co/59iDX5s2ck\nThe expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model,GPT-5,which is expected to launch later this summer.\n“With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. “At times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.”\nThe launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. Earlier on Wednesday,Linda Yaccarino stepped downfrom her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.\nYaccarino’s departure comes just days after Grok’s official, automated X account responded to users withantisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler.xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to haveremoved a recently added section from Grok’s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow, that told it not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims.\nMusk and xAI’s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4’s performance and capabilities.\nxAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work “like a study group” to find the best answer.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 shows frontier level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last Exam— a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity’s Last Exam without “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with “tools,” was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.\nThe nonprofit Arc Prize says thatGrok achieves a new state-of-the-art scoreon its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. That’s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.\nAlongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.\nSuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October.\nxAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.\nDespite Grok’s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.\nToday in crypto, GMX has paused trading after a liquidity pool exploit drained over $40 million. Bybit has confirmed details of the upcoming Pump.fun token sale, and the US has sanctioned a North Korean IT worker ring accused of targeting American companies.\nThe GMX protocolhalted trading on GMX V1after a liquidity pool suffered an exploit on Wednesday, leading to $40 million in funds being stolen and sent to an unknown wallet.\nGMX V1 is the first version of the GMX perpetual exchange deployed on the Arbitrum network. The attacked pool is a liquidity provider for the GMX protocol with a basket of underlying digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and stablecoins,accordingto the GMX team.\nThe protocol has also announced a temporary suspension in minting and redemption of GLP tokens on both Arbitrum and the layer-1 Avalanche network to protect against any additional fallout from the cybersecurity exploit.\nUsers of the platform wereinstructedto disable leverage and change their settings to disable GLP minting.\nBlockchain security company SlowMistattributedthe exploit to a design flaw that allowed hackers to manipulate the GLP token price through the calculation of the total assets under management.\nBybit has confirmeddetails of the much-awaited Pump.fun token sale, revealing that users registered through its European Union-regulated platform, Bybit.eu, will not be able to participate, citing compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nThe public sale of PUMP, the native token of the no-code memecoin launchpad Pump.fun, will open on Saturday at 14:00 UTC and run through Tuesday, according to a Wednesday press release shared with Cointelegraph.A total of 150 billion PUMP tokens, 15% of the 1 trillion total supply, will be offered at a fixed price of $0.004 USDT per token.\nBybit, currently the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is the only major platform participating in the sale, the announcement said. A number of other exchanges will also support the token sale.\nBybit will support subscriptions in USDt (USDT), USDC (USDC), Solana (SOL) and bbSOL, providing access to both stablecoins and Solana-native assets.\nBybit has become the second major crypto exchange to reveal details about the upcoming PUMP token sale, following a slip by Gate.io. On Tuesday, Gate.io briefly published apage outlining a $600 million PUMP token sale, which was quickly taken down.\nIn a Wednesday post on X shortly after the sale was revealed by Bybit, Pump.fun officially announced the token sale. “Our plan is to Kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. On Solana,” the platformwrote.\nPump.fun, launched in January 2024, quickly rose to prominence for enabling users to create and trade memecoins with zero coding skills. The platform’s gamified interface and viral mechanics have driven a wave of onchain experimentation on Solana, transforming casual users into active token creators and traders.\nThe US Treasury on Tuesday sanctioned two people, a North Korean and Russian man, along with four entities involved in what it says was a North Korea-run IT worker ring that infiltrates US crypto companies aiming to exploit them.\nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) slapped sanctions on the North Korea-based Song Kum Hyok for allegedly stealing US citizens’ information to use as aliases and giving the information to hired foreign IT workers who would seek employment at US companies.\nOFAC also sanctioned the Russian national Gayk Asatryan for allegedly using his four Russia-based companies to employ dozens of North Korean IT workers.

Anybody with an idea to improve Ethereum can write and submit a proposal for community review.\nThe update would reduce the time for three consensus steps: block proposals from 4 seconds to 3 seconds, attestations from 4 seconds to 1.5 seconds and aggregation from 4 seconds to 1.5 seconds.That would total 6 seconds, cutting the current 12-second cycle in half and enabling twice as many blocks to be created per minute, while each block remains the same size. This could help smooth out bandwidth and storage demands rather than spiking. Simply put, reducing block time would result in faster confirmations, quicker onchain data fordecentralized applications (DApps)andwallets, plus a more efficient user experience.This appears to be a more effective scaling solution than just increasing the individual block size. Ethereum can’t easily incorporate blocks larger than 10MB without the risk ofnetwork congestionand excluding people with slow internet access. More slot times aim to achieve a higher throughput with more transactions per minute while avoiding making blocks heavier or more complicated to process.Under the hood, it requires changes to gas and blob limits to be halved, while all validator clients need to be updated to handle millisecond price coordination to meet tighter deadlines. Additionally, the attestation schedule would allow for the most time to block propagation, the slowest part of the process.Did you know?Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has made around 20 major upgrades to the network. Each is driven by the EIP process, which often addresses scalability, security and usability issues. With a long-term vision, the community typically takes a cautious approach to upgrades, so it can take years for technical improvements to be implemented.\nThe update would reduce the time for three consensus steps: block proposals from 4 seconds to 3 seconds, attestations from 4 seconds to 1.5 seconds and aggregation from 4 seconds to 1.5 seconds.\nThat would total 6 seconds, cutting the current 12-second cycle in half and enabling twice as many blocks to be created per minute, while each block remains the same size.

Additionally, the attestation schedule would allow for the most time to block propagation, the slowest part of the process.\nReducing Ethereum block times to 6 seconds has its challenges, and the Ethereum community is known for its cautious approach to upgrades.Several concerns will need to be debated and understood, including potential implications such as:Network congestion and propagation delays:Shorter block times result in more blocks being produced (per hour), which can lead to increased network traffic and propagation delays. This can cause network instability and a higher rate of uncle blocks, especially during periods of high transaction volume.Validator performance:The increased frequency for transaction processing and attestations in shorter time frames would make it harder for validators, particularly those with limited computational or networking resources, to keep up. This could lead to missed duties and reduced consensus quality.Security issues:Faster block times could increase the risk of timing-based attacks, includingfront-runningand maximal extractable value (MEV)-related strategies. While not considered a primary concern by core developers, the reduced reaction window does raise potential manipulation risks.Strain on Ethereum clients and infrastructure:All Ethereum client implementations would need to handle higher throughput and shorter synchronization windows, increasing pressure on execution, networking and consensus layers. Poorly optimized clients could fall behind the network.Testing and review:Extensive testing, simulations and testnet deployments will be required to assess the full impact of block time reduction. Any change would need coordination across core developers, client teams and the Ethereum community to ensure safe rollouts.Did you know?In June 2025, Ethereum saw 20 million active addresses interact with the network in one week, the highest ever recorded, reflecting a continued surge in utility and user engagement.\nReducing Ethereum block times to 6 seconds has its challenges, and the Ethereum community is known for its cautious approach to upgrades.\nSeveral concerns will need to be debated and understood, including potential implications such as:\nDid you know?In June 2025, Ethereum saw 20 million active addresses interact with the network in one week, the highest ever recorded, reflecting a continued surge in utility and user engagement.\nThe 6-second block time proposed in Ethereum’s EIP-7782 does not just benefit the technical function of the network but also its users and the broader DeFi ecosystem.Ethereum transaction speed update:Half the block time means transactions would be included and confirmed twice as fast. Faster Ethereum confirmation time delivers a more responsive and speedier network for applications and users.Improved user experience:DApps, wallets and other DeFi platforms would enjoy fresher data along with closer-to-real-time interactions. This is especially helpful fordecentralized exchanges (DEXs), gaming and streaming applications.Enhanced DeFi efficiency:The increased block frequency would allow DEX prices to update faster and reduce arbitrage losses for liquidity providers. Ultimately, that could lower trading fees, deliver tighter spreads and improve liquidity availability.Better layer-2 and cross-chain performance:Faster block production improves communication withlayer-2 networksand cross-chain bridges. It reduces settlement delays,mitigates reorganization (reorg) risksand enhances the reliability of inter-chain operations.Network bandwidth smoothing:Doubling the number of blocks without increasing size allows bandwidth usage to be distributed more evenly, helping nodes stay in sync during validation.\nThe 6-second block time proposed in Ethereum’s EIP-7782 does not just benefit the technical function of the network but also its users and the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThere are clear benefits to the network and user experience for the proposed halving of block times in EIP-7782. The idea aligns with the Ethereum scaling roadmap, which has the broader goal of improving layer-1 performance. A major part of this is making the network more appealing to real-time applications and preparing for future protocol upgrades.However, Ethereum validator challenges need to be addressed, but they appear manageable should the proposal make it through the EIP process. Ethereum clients and staking providers have matured significantly, and with careful coordination, the network should adapt.Key to this transition will be:Monitoring validator performance across testnetsStress-testing under high-volume conditionsEnsuring client diversity and optimization.Additionally, Ethereum has a strong track record of executing technically complex upgrades with success:The Merge (2022): Transitioned the network from proof-of-work (PoW) to PoS with no downtime, reducing energy use by 99.95%.Shanghai/Capella (2023): Enabled full validator withdrawals, adding flexibility and improving decentralization.Dencun Upgrade (2024): Introducedproto-danksharding (EIP-4844), dramatically lowering rollup fees and boosting L2 scalability.These milestones show Ethereum’s ability to evolve while safeguarding decentralization and network health. Each upgrade has laid the groundwork for the next, and the proposed slot time reduction builds on this stable foundation.This proposal also prepares Ethereum for future upgrades, including:Verkle treesfor state efficiencyFull danksharding for data availability scalingStateless clients and other long-term decentralization improvements.By reducing slot time, Ethereum takes another step toward a more interactive, scalable and user-centric platform without compromising on its core values of security, neutrality and resilience.\nThere are clear benefits to the network and user experience for the proposed halving of block times in EIP-7782.

In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social network, X, whichwas recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also putGrok’s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.\nIntroducing Grok 4, the world's most powerful AI model. Watch the livestream now:https://t.co/59iDX5s2ck\nThe expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model,GPT-5,which is expected to launch later this summer.\n“With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. “At times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.”\nThe launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. Earlier on Wednesday,Linda Yaccarino stepped downfrom her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.\nYaccarino’s departure comes just days after Grok’s official, automated X account responded to users withantisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler.xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to haveremoved a recently added section from Grok’s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow, that told it not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims.\nMusk and xAI’s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4’s performance and capabilities.\nxAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work “like a study group” to find the best answer.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 shows frontier level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last Exam— a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity’s Last Exam without “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with “tools,” was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.\nThe nonprofit Arc Prize says thatGrok achieves a new state-of-the-art scoreon its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. That’s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.\nAlongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.\nSuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October.\nxAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.\nDespite Grok’s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

The new long-wheelbase version of the luxury sedan is expected to go on sale in China in 2027, the report said, without revealing further details.

The company’s China operations currently includes around 120 staff.\nWhy it matters:The move underscores how emerging AI Startups from China are increasingly relocating core operations overseas, amid a push for international markets and potential regulatory uncertainties at home. Manus has quickly become one of China’s most talked-about generative AI agent players, yet faces skepticism over its product depth and long-term monetization.\nDetails：On Tuesday night, Manus responded to Chinese media outlet The Paper, saying it had adjusted certain business teams to improve operational efficiency, and would continue to focus on developing its core business. In June, Manus’s head of product Zhang Tao publicly confirmed that the company had already moved its headquarters from China to Singapore.\nContext：Manuswas launched this March by the Monica team, branding itself as the world’s first general-purpose AI agent capable of independently planning and executing complex tasks across areas like report writing, spreadsheet creation, resume screening, stock analysis, and travel planning. The product initially opened via invitation-only beta, with invite codes speculatively priced at over RMB 10,000 ($ 1,394), sparking accusations of hype-driven marketing.\nIt’s also notable that in May, reports surfaced claiming Manus’s parent company was seeking to raise $100 million at a $1.5 billionvaluation. Manus denied the report, calling it “severely inaccurate,” and stated it was focusing on product development and user experience.\nWith a small team, TechNode provides timely news and thoughtfully researched articles for worldwide readers interested in learning more about the Chinese tech industry.\nYour contribution is appreciated.\nShuang is a Shanghai-based tech reporter at Technode.com, covering AI, tech company, e-commerce and retail.

This collaboration unlocks access to over$500 millionin Bitcoin liquidity for Sui’s high-performance DeFi ecosystem, known for its near-zero fees, sub-second finality, and exceptional capital efficiency.\nThreshold Network’s tBTC is a decentralized, trust-minimized onchain version of Bitcoin that preserves Bitcoin’s core principles while enabling liquidity across DeFi ecosystems. Now live on Sui, tBTC empowers users to trade, lend, and engage in advanced DeFi strategies within a secure, scalable environment, with transaction finality as fast as 400 milliseconds.\nSui will be the first non-EVM chain to supportdirect mintingon the Threshold app, expanding accessibility and reinforcing its position as a premier destination for Bitcoin liquidity. On Sui, tBTC can participate in DeFi strategies within a high-speed, scalable environment—from trading and lending to more specialized use cases, such as serving as collateral on protocols like Bucket, while preserving its core properties.\n“Bitcoin was designed to be used, not locked away,” says Callan “Sap” Sarre, Co-founder and CPO at Threshold Labs. “With tBTC on Sui, we’re combining the security of threshold cryptography with a high-throughput network to create a new standard for Bitcoin utility.\n\nThe integration will expand Sui’s growing Bitcoin ecosystem across four Sui-native protocols:\nAdditionally, users can also mint tBTC directly on Sui via the Threshold dApp, providing a secure and easy access point to BTCFi.

Since February 2025, a substantial amount of Bitcoin volume has flowed into Sui-native protocols. The integration of tBTC will strengthen this ecosystem by:\nAs the world’s most valuable digital asset gains momentum and utility, Bitcoin expands beyond serving as a store of value to power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nTo support the launch of Threshold’s tBTC on Sui, Threshold and Sui are kicking off a three-month campaign to facilitate long-term adoption. The initiative includes protocol-level developer support and ecosystem-wide activations to ensure the Bitcoin Standard flourishes in modern DeFi applications. This also includes limited-time incentives on select Sui DeFi Protocols, namelyBucket, AlphaLend, and Bluefin.\n“BTC is expected to bring a massive amount of Bitcoin liquidity to Sui, creating a bridge that truly matters for institutions and everyday people who love Bitcoin,” said Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Mysten Labs, the original contributors to Sui. “This integration opens another door to accessible, sovereign BTCfi participation.\nBitcoin was never meant to sit idle.

In recent months, Grok has become more deeply integrated into Musk’s social network, X, whichwas recently acquired by xAI. However, that has also putGrok’s misbehavior front and center for millions of users.\nIntroducing Grok 4, the world's most powerful AI model. Watch the livestream now:https://t.co/59iDX5s2ck\nThe expectations are high for Grok 4. The latest AI model from xAI will be stacked up against OpenAI’s forthcoming AI model,GPT-5,which is expected to launch later this summer.\n“With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” said Elon Musk during a livestream Wednesday night. “At times, it may lack common sense, and it has not yet invented new technologies or discovered new physics, but that is just a matter of time.”\nThe launch of Grok 4 comes amid a tumultuous week for Elon Musk’s companies. Earlier on Wednesday,Linda Yaccarino stepped downfrom her role as the CEO of X after roughly two years with the company. X has yet to announce her successor.\nYaccarino’s departure comes just days after Grok’s official, automated X account responded to users withantisemitic comments criticizing Hollywood’s “Jewish executives” and praising Hitler.xAI had to briefly limit Grok’s account and delete the offensive posts. In response to the incident, xAI appeared to haveremoved a recently added section from Grok’s public system prompt, a list of instructions for the AI chatbot to follow, that told it not to shy away from making “politically incorrect” claims.\nMusk and xAI’s leaders largely avoided discussing the incident, instead focusing on Grok 4’s performance and capabilities.\nxAI launched two models on Wednesday: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy — the latter being the company’s “multi-agent version” that offers increased performance. Musk claimed that Grok 4 Heavy spawns multiple agents to work on a problem simultaneously, and then they all compare their work “like a study group” to find the best answer.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 shows frontier level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last Exam— a challenging test measuring AI’s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions on subjects like math, humanities, and natural science. According to xAI, Grok 4 scored 25.4% on Humanity’s Last Exam without “tools,” outperforming Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 21.6%, and OpenAI’s o3 (high), which scored 21%.\nxAI claims that Grok 4 Heavy, with “tools,” was able to achieve a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools, which scored 26.9%.\nThe nonprofit Arc Prize says thatGrok achieves a new state-of-the-art scoreon its ARC-AGI-2 test — another difficult benchmark that consists of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns — scoring 16.2%. That’s nearly twice the score of the next best commercial AI model, Claude Opus 4.\nAlongside Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, xAI launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, a $300-per-month subscription called SuperGrok Heavy. Subscribers to the plan will get an early preview to Grok 4 Heavy, as well as early access to new features. The plan is similar to ultra-premium tiers offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, but xAI now offers the most expensive subscription among major AI providers.\nSuperGrok Heavy subscribers may get early access to some new products xAI plans to launch in the coming months. The company said Wednesday that an AI coding model is coming in August, a multi-modal agent in September, and a video generation model in October.\nxAI is releasing Grok 4 through its API in an effort to get developers to build applications with the model. The company notes that xAI’s enterprise sector is only two months old, however, it plans to work with hyperscalers to make Grok available through their cloud platforms.\nDespite Grok’s frontier-level performance on benchmarks, it may prove difficult for xAI to move past its recent mishaps as it tries to pitch Grok to businesses as a real contender to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, flaws and all, remains to be seen.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond — founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

Marketing itself as an “anti-Cluely,” Truely claims it can detect the use of unauthorized applications by interviewees or others during online meetings.\nBut Truely’s launch didn’t faze Lee.\n“We don’t care if we’re able to be detected or not,” Lee told TechCrunch last week. “The invisibility function is not a core feature of Cluely. It’s a nifty add-on. In fact, most enterprises opt to disable the invisibility altogether because of legal implications.”\nLee responded to Shen on X by praising Truely, but adding that Cluely “will likely start prompting our users to be much more transparent about usage.”\nSince securing a$15 million Series Afrom Andreessen Horowitz last month, Cluely has shifted its marketing strategy away from promoting ‘cheating.’  The company’s tagline has recentlybeen changedfrom “cheat on everything” to “Everything You Need. Before You Ask. … This feels like cheating.”\nCluely’s marketing tactics have been described asrage-bait marketing, and now it seems that the company has baited us into thinking of its technology as a cheating tool.\nHowever, Lee has much bigger ambitions for Cluely: to take the place of ChatGPT.\n“Every time you would reach for chatgpt.com, our goal is to create a world where you instead reach for Cluely,” Lee said. “Cluely does functionally the same thing as ChatGPT.

It’s building this platform in partnership with Austria’s Bitpanda Technology Solutions and the Swiss custodian Taurus.Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, serving nearly 50 million Germans through its Sparkasse app,plans to embedretail crypto trading directly into its existing mobile infrastructure, with a go-live target of mid-2026.Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken (Genobanken), Germany’s cooperative banking network, is following suit. Through a partnership withBörse Stuttgart Digital, they’re preparing their own crypto trading and custody options.These coordinated moves come on the heels of theMiCA regulation rollout, which offers long-awaited legal clarity for digital asset services across the EU.For traditional banks, the timing is perfect: The risk of early entry has passed, and the frameworks for regulated crypto in Germany are, as of 2025, clearly defined.Did you know?By 2025, nearly one-third of Germans (30% ) are expected to own crypto, up from under 6% in 2022, an adoption spike of 450% in just three years.\nIn a move set to redefine EU finance, some of Germany’s most powerful banks are entering crypto — on their own terms.\nDeutsche Bank, with more than 1.6 trillion euro ($1.9 trillion) in assets under management, and the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, which oversees over $2.3 trillion,are preparing to launchregulated crypto services for institutional and retail clients by 2026.\nImportantly, it represents a step towarddigital assetsfrom some of the continent’s most conservative institutions.\nThese coordinated moves come on the heels of theMiCA regulation rollout, which offers long-awaited legal clarity for digital asset services across the EU.\nFor traditional banks, the timing is perfect: The risk of early entry has passed, and the frameworks for regulated crypto in Germany are, as of 2025, clearly defined.\n\nDid you know?By 2025, nearly one-third of Germans (30% ) are expected to own crypto, up from under 6% in 2022, an adoption spike of 450% in just three years.\nAs we hinted in the section above, three names pop up in particular.Deutsche BankGermany’s largest bank is no stranger to digital infrastructure.

Since launching in late May, Almond’s blockchain-based optimization technology has powered over $2 million SGD in transfers through this corridor—delivering exchange rates consistently better than mid-market FX rates and unavailable elsewhere in the industry. These results reflect the same transformative impact that earned Almond consecutive industry recognition in 2023 and 2024.\n“This partnership represents a natural evolution in our mission to remove barriers in global financial transfers,” said Adam Swartzbaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of Almond FinTech. “We’ve always believed true innovation comes from deeply understanding customers’ needs and building solutions that not only solve today’s problems but anticipate tomorrow’s. In a crowded and commoditized space, Ample stands out for its commitment to leveraging technology to deliver meaningful value to its customers—making them an ideal partner for our expansion across Asia.”\nProven Performance Meets Regulatory Excellence\nAmple has been licensed as a Major Payment Institution by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for over 25 years, establishing its credibility as a trusted financial services provider. The partnership validates Almond’s ability to deliver superior performance while meeting Singapore’s regulatory requirements. Almond leverages a multitude of stablecoins as bridge assets to optimize cross-border treasury transfers between fiat currencies. Almond’s technology aggregates real-time market data to identify the most cost-effective and efficient transfer routes. This same breakthrough infrastructure is active across 10 countries and supports over 100 digital currencies.\nFor Ample, this enables:\nInnovation Leadership Drives Market Expansion\nThis partnership demonstrates Almond’s continued technology leadership in cross-border payments. The company’s consecutive CrossTech Innovation Awards underscore its role as an industry pioneer, consistently delivering solutions that address critical financial challenges globally.\n“Receiving this award is a testament to our team’s relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of financial technology,” said Swartzbaugh, referencing Almond’s recent recognition. “This partnership with Ample shows how award-winning innovation translates directly into enhanced services for financial institutions and their customers. One of our strongest value propositions is helping clients optimize across multiple stablecoins, not just one, enabling better liquidity, tighter spreads, and more flexibility without complicating onboarding.”\nEmbedded within Ample’s technology stack that powers their customer-facing and internal treasury operations, Almond’s technology enhances backend efficiency—delivering the same optimization capabilities that have positioned Almond as a leader in B2B cross-border payments.\nStrategic Growth in Southeast Asia\nThe partnership with Ample positions Almond FinTech for continued growth across Southeast Asian markets, where digital payment adoption creates opportunities for technological enhancement. This expansion reflects Almond’s strategy of partnering with established, regulated institutions to deliver cutting-edge payment solutions.\n“We believe that stablecoins are the future, and powering remittances with them is the way forward. Partnering with Almond has allowed us to harness that future safely, through a treasury layer that delivers faster, cheaper, and more reliable settlement. For our customers, nothing changes on the surface—but under the hood, we’re moving with the times.” — Matthew Yap, CEO, Ample Transfers.\n\n\nOutput:\nSummary: [Your Traditional Chinese summary here]", "response": "杏仁金融科技(Almond FinTech)與新加坡匯款公司Ample Transfers合作，利用區塊鏈技術優化新加坡至印尼的跨境支付(cross-border payments)。此合作利用多種穩定幣(stablecoins)優化內部資金和結算作業，自五月底以來已處理超過200萬新元交易，匯率優於市場中間價。此舉標誌著杏仁金融科技拓展東南亞市場的重要里程碑，並展現其在B2B跨境支付領域的領導地位。此合作驗證了杏仁金融科技技術的效能及符合新加坡監管要求的能力。\n", "summary": "杏仁金融科技(Almond FinTech)與新加坡匯款公司Ample Transfers合作，利用區塊鏈技術優化新加坡至印尼的跨境支付(cross-border payments)。此合作利用多種穩定幣(stablecoins)優化內部資金和結算作業，自五月底以來已處理超過200萬新元交易，匯率優於市場中間價。此舉標誌著杏仁金融科技拓展東南亞市場的重要里程碑，並展現其在B2B跨境支付領域的領導地位。此合作驗證了杏仁金融科技技術的效能及符合新加坡監管要求的能力。"}
