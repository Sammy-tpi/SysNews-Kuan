To work on a team led byformer Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wangand at a desk physically near Zuckerberg, Meta has reportedly offered employees from OpenAI and Google DeepMindcompensation packages worth upwards of $100 million.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed those reports on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman, which waspublished on Tuesday.However, the OpenAI CEO noted that Zuckerberg’s recruiting efforts have been largely unsuccessful and made sure to throw a few more digs at Meta in the process.\nNew episode of Uncapped with@sama. Enjoy 🤗pic.twitter.com/2IxYt3B4Gm\n“[Meta has] started making these, like, giant offers to a lot of people on our team,” Sam Altman said on the podcast. “You know, like, $100 million signing bonuses, more than that [in] compensation per year […] I’m really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.”\nThe OpenAI CEO said he believed his employees made the assessment that OpenAI had a better chance of achieving AGI and may one day be the more valuable company. He also said he believes Meta’s focus on high compensation packages for employees, rather than the mission of delivering AGI, would likely not create a great culture.\nMeta reportedly tried topoachone of OpenAI’s lead researchers, Noam Brown, as well as Google’s AI architect, Koray Kavukcuoglu. However, both efforts were unsuccessful.\nSam Altman went on to say he believes OpenAI’s culture of innovation has been a major key to its success, and that Meta’s “current AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped.” The OpenAI CEO said he respects many things about Meta but noted he doesn’t “think they’re a company that’s great at innovation.” Later in the podcast, Altman said he believes it’s not enough for companies to catch up on AI — they have to truly innovate to stay ahead.\nThe OpenAI CEO’s comments highlight some of the challenges that Meta has to overcome in order to build out a successful AI superintelligence lab. Besides bringing on Wang, Meta announced last week that itinvested significantlyin Wang’s former company, Scale AI. The company has also reportedlynabbed a few star AI researchers, such as Google DeepMind’s Jack Rae and Sesame AI’s Johan Schalkwyk. But there’s more work ahead.\nIn the coming year, Meta will have to staff up its new AI team while OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind operate at full speed. In the coming months, OpenAI is expected torelease an open AI modelthat’s likely to set Meta back in the AI race even further.\nLater on in the podcast, Sam Altman described an AI-powered social media feed that seems likely to encroach on Meta’s apps. The OpenAI CEO said he’s curious about exploring a social media app that uses AI to deliver custom feeds based on what users want, rather than the default, algorithmic feed that exists on traditional social media apps.\nOpenAI is reportedlyworking on a social networking appinternally. Meanwhile, Meta is experimenting with an AI-powered social network through its Meta AI app. However, it seems that some users are confused by the Meta AI app and have shared somehyperpersonal chats with the broader world.\nWhether AI-powered social networks take off remains to be seen. In the meantime, Zuckerberg and Sam Altman seem poised to butt heads over the AI talent race.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

It says, “Under this award, the performer will develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains.”\nWhether that reference to war-fighting applies to the weapons themselves or just other areas associated with wars, like paperwork, remains to be seen. OpenAI’s guidelines do forbid individual users to use ChatGPT or its APIs to develop or use weapons. However, OpenAI deleted the explicit prohibitions of “military and warfare” in its terms of service backin January 2024.\nGiven how heavily some powerful people in Silicon Valley have warned of the dangers of China’s advanced LLM models, it’s not surprising the DoD wants to use OpenAI for whatever purposes it wants. For instance, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, an OpenAI investor, recently appeared on Jack Altman’s “Uncapped” podcast (Jack is Sam Altman’s brother). Andreessen described the race between China’s AI andthe Western world’s models as a “cold war.”\nStill, perhaps an equally interesting part of this announcement is what it says about OpenAI’sincreasingly strained relationship with its major investor Microsoft.\nMicrosofthas thousands of contractswith the federal government worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It has, for decades, been implementing the strict security protocols necessary for the government — especially the DoD — to use its cloud.\nOpenAI announced this deal as part of its broader new “OpenAI for Government” program, which consolidates a number of other programs it uses to sell wares directly to government agencies, including the U.S. National Labs⁠, the Air Force Research Laboratory, NASA, NIH, and the Treasury, according to the company.\nBut it was only in April thatMicrosoft announcedthe DoD had approved its Azure OpenAI Service for all classified levels. Now the DoD is also going straight to the source.

The problem has reduced the visibility of users’ posts because many people on the platform have configured their settings to hide mature content by default.\nAccording to numerous posts from impacted Tumblr users, posts have been falsely flagged despite not being sexual or violent, and these false takedowns have included everything fromcat GIFs to fandom contenttoartand even apicture of hands. Some suspect that AI-based automation could be to blame for the issues.\nSimilar accusations have plagued other social media platforms in recent weeks. For instance, Pinterest finally admitted that an internal errorled to its mass user bans. Meanwhile, Instagram this week declined tocomment on its own trouble with mass bansthat users said have been given little coverage or attention outside of online complaints on apps like X and Reddit.\nIn both cases, users suspected that AI-based moderation was to blame, though Pinterest denied that was the case.\nOn Tumblr, the flagging issue is tied to an update to the Android app, where the company said it’s been experimenting with improvements to its mature content filtering systems. Specifically, it was testing out a new layer of moderation toContent Labels, the company told TechCrunch.\nA spokesperson for Tumblr said the experiments are continuing and, based on user feedback, will be improved before the changes roll out to other platforms.\n“As we work to make Tumblr a safer place for all users, we aim to respect a diverse set of interests and content preferences, which can be adjusted in settings. We view this as an ongoing process as we continue to fine-tune how we detect and address mature content,” a Tumblr spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company alsoacknowledged the problem on its blog, responding to a user’s question about the falsely flagged posts. Here, Tumblr’s team noted they were aware of the “incorrect classification issues” and were actively working to reduce them.\nIn addition, the post explained that Tumblr’s appeal process was being updated in the weeks ahead to be able to handle a higher volume of cases. (Tumblr did not respond to our questions about the appeals process’ planned changes.)\nWhether AI or other automation is to blame is not clear, as Tumblr wouldn’t speak specifically to the cause of the new issues. However, the reduced staffing at the blogging service has likely also played a role.\nFollowing its 2019acquisitionby WordPress.com maker Automattic,Tumblr has faced layoffsas its staff was reassigned toother projects at the parent company. Last year, Automattic announced that Tumblr’s back end would also bemoved to WordPressto make management easier and stemits financial losses.\nTopics\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated.\nApplied Intuition’s raise comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. The company makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions. That includes simulation software and managing data.\n“When they think like, ‘I have this software or AI problem,’ we generally want them to think about us,” CEO Qasar Younis told TechCrunch last year. “Like we want to be that first call.”\nApplied Intuition works with most of the major automakers, as well as autonomous vehicle companies such as Gatik and Kodiak.\nThe company has also increasingly pushed into the defense space. In its newsletter announcing the funding round, Applied Intuition shared that it was asked by the U.S. Army to help bringautonomous tech to some of its vehicles. The company was able to take an infantry squad vehicle from “bare bones” to autonomous in just 10 days. This included developing a “pedal-pushing robot to physically turn the wheel and press the throttle and brake pads.”\nCorrection: This article was updated to include that Applied Intuition closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer.

Anysphere also says Cursor users on the Ultra plan will get priority access to new features.\nAnysphere CEO Michael Truell said in the blog that the Ultra plan was made possible through multi-year partnerships with AI model providers. In the last several months, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have similarly rolled out pricier subscription plans — ranging from$100 a monthto$250 a month— as part of an effort to capitalize on their power users and offer them increased usage.\nThe new, pricy Cursor subscription plan seems poised to add revenue to Anysphere’s already booming business. Earlier this month, Anysphere announced that Cursor hadreached $500 million in annualized recurring revenueand is being used by major companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe.\nAnysphere was one of the fastest companies ever to reach $100 million in ARR, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Based onTechCrunch’s previous reporting, Cursor’s ARR has grown by $200 million since April.\nHowever, the race to develop “vibe-coding” tools is heating up, and many of the AI model providers Cursor relies on are developing their own AI coding products. OpenAI has reportedlyacquired Cursor’s competitor, Windsurf, to beef up its offerings of AI coding products. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to develop Claude Code, its in-house AI coding tool that utilizes its popular AI models.\nIt’s unclear whether Anysphere can sustain this level of growth without bumping into AI model providers. We’ve seen more competitive tactics emerge in the AI coding space as these businesses have grown. For example, Anthropic recentlyslashed Windsurf’s direct access to Claude AI modelsas a means to undercut its largest competitor, OpenAI.\nAt the same time, Anysphere has started putting more resources toward developing its own AI models that work alongside models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In May, Anysphere rolled out anew “Tab” AI model, which can suggest code changes across various files.\nIn a recent interview with TechCrunch, Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan said he believed Anthropic would be working with Cursor for a long time. Anysphere’s multi-year partnerships with Anthropic and other AI model providers certainly suggest these relationships aren’t going anywhere just yet. Nonetheless, the competition for users is getting more intense.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

    "content": "On June 15, Luo Yonghao’s digital avatar hosted its first livestream on Baidu’s e-commerce platform, attracting more than 13 million views and generating over 55 million yuan ($7.66 million) in gross merchandise value. Several 3C and food product categories reportedly surpassed the sales figures from Luo’s real-person debut in May, marking a new high for AI-driven livestreams. The session featured several technical firsts for the industry. It was the first time a top-tier Chinese influencer was represented by an AI-generated avatar for an entire livestream, which lasted more than six hours. The stream also introduced multi-avatar interaction, with Luo’s avatar and a co-host engaging in synchronized gestures and banter, mimicking real human behavior. According to Baidu, the AI system drew from a 13,000-item knowledge base and generated 97,000 words of product descriptions, coordinating more than 8,300 avatar movements during the session. Luo, founder of Smartisan Technology and Thin Red Line, began livestreaming sales on Douyin to pay off his debts. He continued until 2022, when he announced his exit from all social media to focus on Thin Red Line. [Technode report]",

    "title": "AI 大數據助攻志願填寫，分析落點成考生新利器",
    "content": "隨著國中教育會考成績出爐，進入緊鑼密鼓的志願填寫階段。在台灣，無論是國中升高中，或高中升大學，考試依然是無法避免的重要關卡。隨著升學制度日趨多元，校系選擇豐富，考生與家長面臨的抉擇也越來越複雜。\n\n傳統的志願填寫多仰賴學校教師的經驗建議與家長的主觀判斷，難以全面評估每個學生的實際落點機率。如今隨著AI與大數據技術的應用逐步普及，結合歷年錄取資料與成績分布的落點分析系統，成為新一代考生的升學利器。\n傳統的落點分析，主要依賴前一年度的錄取分數、積分區間和歷年錄取趨勢，依靠教師與輔導升學人員對歷屆錄取分數的經驗與觀察來推估志願順位，這樣的方式常常無法即時反映當年度考生的分數分布變化。僅根據靜態歷史數據，對於校系篩選標準、篩選倍率、招生政策等年度變動反應遲緩，導致預測結果不夠精準。特別是當升學環境變化快速、學生選擇多元化時，傳統方式容易出現「高分落榜」、「低分填高」等落點錯判情況。\nAI大數據落點分析系統的出現，為志願填寫帶來了前所未有的革新。首先，在資料整合方面，AI系統能即時蒐集並比對當年度所有考生成績、志願填寫行為與歷年錄取資料，並且根據變動資料動態的修正其預測模型。\n其次，這些系統運用多重演算法，不僅依據多年累積的數據分析趨勢，更能即時納入當年使用者的實際填寫行為。透過模型判斷哪些校系可能被高估或低估，並據此提供個人化的志願建議，有效降低落榜風險，提升錄取的機會。\n在個人化層面，AI系統的演進能針對考生的成績進行比對，更進一步分析其學習歷程、核心能力與興趣偏好，有些系統甚至納入職涯相關指標，例如未來就業領域與期望薪資，協助考生找到與自身優勢和校系需求最契合的選擇。這類系統通常也具備即時回饋與追蹤功能。\n考生可以主動設定追蹤感興趣的校系，系統則會持續更新該校系的申請熱度與預估錄取分數變動情況。這不僅讓志願填寫策略更具彈性，也能因應市場變動做出前瞻性的調整。這些系統不再只是「比分數」的工具，而是逐漸轉型為能夠提供即時數據整合、個人潛能分析與升學策略建議的智慧平台。\n依筆者過往經驗，即時資料整合將成為發展重點。透過與各考招單位、國高中職、輔導單位的資料串接，這些系統能快速反映招生名額變化、志願填寫趨勢與錄取標準更新，強化預測模型的準確度。這種「動態升級」的特性，對學生而言是一大助力，能幫助他們做出更即時、彈性的策略調整。AI在深度個人化與適性推薦方面的應用更令人期待。未來結合大型語言模型（LLMs）與學習歷程資料，不僅能協助學生理解自己的學習特質，還能針對性地提出校系建議，甚至搭配職涯發展藍圖。\n不過，隨著AI系統的影響力愈來愈大，我們也不能忽視公平性與倫理的問題。如何確保演算法不因資料偏誤導致資源傾斜？怎麼確保學生的個資安全？這些都是未來必須面對的挑戰。AI可以輔助決策，但不應取代人的價值判斷，這點值得教育單位與技術開發者共同關注。\nAI大數據落點分析系統正在重新定義「升學輔導」的方式。對學生來說，這是一個機會，也是一份責任——要學會運用數據做選擇，同時也保有對自我未來的主動思考。未來的志願填寫，不再只是「填哪裡能上」，而是「選擇一條最適合自己的路」。\n（首圖來源：shutterstock）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "AI 醫療診斷仍有缺陷，LLM 問診準確率僅 34.5%",
    "content": "大型語言模型（LLM）醫學考試表現優異等報導近年不絕於耳，GPT-4 2023 年已能正確回答美國醫學執照考試題目達 90%，之後更超越考試住院醫生和執業醫生。但牛津大學最新研究發現，LLM 現實應用表現遠不如考試成績亮眼。\n牛津大學研究員發現，LLM 直接處理測試場景時能正確辨識病症率達 94.9%，但人類用 LLM 診斷相同場景時，正確辨識病症率卻低於 34.5%。更令人意外的是，使用 LLM 的患者表現甚至比對照組更差，對照組為「通常在家會用的任何方法」自我診斷。\nAdam Mahdi 博士領導團隊招募 1,298 名參與者扮演患者與 LLM 互動。每位參與者給予詳細疾病背景，從肺炎到普通感冒等，以及生活細節和病史，但不給予正確答案。如 20 歲工程系學生與朋友外出時突然劇烈頭痛，重要細節為低頭時疼痛和誤導資訊：經常飲酒、與六名朋友合租、剛考過壓力大的考試。\n三種 LLM 參與測試：普及性選 GPT-4o、開放權重選 Llama 3、檢索增強生成（RAG）能力選 Command R+。參與者要求至少用 LLM 一次以取得自我診斷和行動方案。\n參與者用 LLM 診斷病症的一致性低於對照組。用 LLM 的參與者最多只有 34.5% 能找出至少一種相關病，對照組為 47.0%。選擇正確行動方案率也只有 44.2%，相比之下 LLM 獨立運作時為 56.3%。\n研究員回顧對話紀錄發現，參與者給 LLM 的資訊都不完整，LLM 也會誤解人類提示。分到得膽結石的用戶只告訴 LLM：「我有嚴重胃痛，持續長達一小時，讓我嘔吐，似乎與外賣有關」，遺漏了疼痛位置、嚴重程度和頻率。Command R+ 錯誤診斷參與者消化不良，參與者也猜錯病症。\n即使 LLM 答對疾病，參與者也不一定相信。65.7% 的 GPT-4o 對話提出至少一種病症，但不到 34.5% 參與者最終答案有參考模型提出的病症。\n北卡羅萊納大學教堂山分校文藝復興運算研究所（RENCI）用戶體驗專家 Nathalie Volkheimer 認為這研究有用但不令人驚訝：「對我們記得早期網路搜尋體驗的人來說，這很似曾相識。大型語言模型等工具需要提示詞達特定品質，特別在你期望有高品質輸出時。」\nVolkheimer 指經歷劇烈疼痛的人不會說出多有品質的提示詞。雖然實驗參與者只是模擬病人，但也沒有說出所有細節。她警告：「我不會把重點放在機器，應該是人機互動。」她以汽車是為了讓人從 A 點到 B 點而製造比喻，但許多其他因素也有作用。\n團隊嘗試用 AI 測試者取代人類。他們找 LLM 扮演病人，用一般語言簡化術語並保持問題陳述合理簡短。模擬參與者用相同 LLM 工具時，平均 60.7% 能正確辨識病症，人類低於 34.5%。這顯示 LLM 與其他 LLM 互動比和人類互動更明白清楚，成為現實表現的不良預測指標。\n這項研究提醒 AI 工程師和協調專家：如果 LLM 是要與人類互動，僅靠非互動式基準測試會對現實能力產生危險的假安全感。企業部署聊天機器人前，需理解受眾、目標和客戶體驗。\nVolkheimer 建議：「每種客服環境，如果客戶沒有做你希望他們做的事，最後才責怪客戶。首先要問為什麼，不是憑直覺『為什麼』，而是深入調查、細節、人類學、心理學、經過檢驗的『為什麼』。」\n沒有精心規劃的培訓材料，LLM 將「吐出大家都討厭的通用答案，這就是人們討厭聊天機器人的原因」。Volkheimer 說：「不是因為聊天機器人很糟糕或技術有問題。而是因為輸入品質很糟糕。」\n企業需要認識 LLM 標準化測試的優異表現不能直接看成實際應用成功，團隊必須投入時間理解真實用戶如何表達問題、知識水準和溝通習慣。只有全面人機互動測試和持續改良，才能真正發揮 AI 醫療和其他範疇的潛力。\n越來越多企業想啟用 AI 系統，這項研究提供寶貴教訓：技術力只是成功的一部分，理解和設計良好的人機互動同樣重要。企業必須超越簡單的準確率指標，真正關注用戶現實世界如何與 AI 互動。\n（本文由Unwire Pro授權轉載；首圖來源：shutterstock）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "content": "亞馬遜旗下雲端運算供應事業 AWS 正在透過其客製化晶片 (ASIC) 策略，有效削減 GPU 大廠輝達 (NVIDIA) 在人工智慧 (AI) 領域的主導地位，並已展現出成果。\n\n根據 CNBC 的報導，AWS 的主要目標是降低 AI 訓練成本，並為市場提供輝達昂貴圖形處理單元（GPU）的替代方案。因此，AWS 即將宣布其 Graviton 4 晶片的更新內容。Graviton 4 是一個中央處理單元（CPU），將提供每秒 600 Gbps 的網路頻寬，AWS 稱之為公共雲中的最高水準，而 AWS 將這種速度比喻為機器每秒可讀取 100 張音樂 CD。Graviton 4 晶片是亞馬遜位於德州奧斯汀的 Annapurna Labs 所開發的眾多晶片產品之一。這項晶片的成功預計是 AWS ASIC 策略的一大勝利，使其能與英特爾和 AMD 等傳統半導體公司競爭。\n然而，AWS 真正的競爭焦點在於人工智慧基礎設施領域，其主要對手是輝達。在 AWS 2024 年 12 月的 re:Invent 大會上，AWS 宣布了 Project Rainier，這是一個為旗下新創公司 Anthropic 打造的AI超級電腦。AWS 已向 Anthropic 投入 80 億美元的資金。值得注意的是，Anthropic 的 Claude Opus 4 人工智慧模型是在 AWS 的 Trainium 2 GPU上發表的。 Project Rainier 由超過 50 萬個 Trainium 2 晶片提供動力，這筆訂單在過去一般會下訂輝達的 GPU 產品。\nAWS 表示，儘管輝達的 Blackwell 晶片效能更高，但 AWS的 Trainium 2 晶片提供了更優越的成本效益。另外，Trainium 3 將於 2025 年推出，其效能將會是 Trainium 2 的兩倍，並且能額外節省 50% 的能源。\n根據 AWS Annapurna Labs 高層的說法，這些 AWS 晶片的需求已經超出了供應，儘管 AWS 的供應量非常龐大。隨著 Graviton 4 的升級和 Project Rainier 中 Trainium 晶片的應用， Amazon 正展現其更巨大的企圖心，那就是控制整個 AI 基礎設施，從網路到訓練再到推論模型。隨著越來越多像 Claude 4 這樣的主要 AI 模型進一步證明它們可以在非輝達的硬體上成功訓練，使得當前市場已經不再是 AWS 能否與輝達這個晶片巨頭競爭，而是它能夠奪取多少市場占比。至於，Graviton 4 更新的時間，則預計將在 6 月底前提供。\n(首圖來源：亞馬遜)\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "主導權之爭成導火線，OpenAI 與微軟六年合作關係陷入危機",
    "content": "《華爾街日報》報導，被譽為科技史上最成功合作的 OpenAI 與微軟關係正面臨前所未有的挑戰。近期雙方緊張局勢急劇升溫，核心爭議圍繞 OpenAI 轉型為營利性公司以及 Windsurf 收購案的智財權歸屬問題。\n知情人士透露，OpenAI高層近期考慮採取所謂「核選項」（nuclear option），公開指控微軟有反競爭行為，並尋求聯邦監管機構審查雙方合約是否違反反壟斷法。此舉可能徹底改變這段維持六年的合作關係。雖然雙方聯合聲明表示「會談仍在進行，對未來合作充滿信心」，但內部分歧顯然難以掩蓋。\nOpenAI以30億美元收購AI程式新創公司Windsurf的交易成為雙方矛盾的焦點。根據現有協議，微軟可存取OpenAI所有智財權，但OpenAI不願將Windsurf智財權交給微軟，因為這可能強化微軟自家的競爭產品GitHub Copilot。\n另一關鍵議題是OpenAI轉型為「公益公司」後的股權分配。微軟要求的股份比例遠超OpenAI願意給予的範圍。對OpenAI而言，這已是一場時間賽跑，若未能在年底前完成轉型，可能損失高達200億美元的融資。\n自2019年微軟首次投資10億美元以來，這段合作已讓雙方深度綁定。微軟擁有OpenAI軟體工具在Azure雲端平台的獨家銷售權和優先技術存取權，且本應是OpenAI唯一的運算資源供應商。然而，隨著雙方在聊天機器人和企業AI工具等領域轉為競爭對手，這種關係變得更加複雜。\n現在，OpenAI希望能與其他雲端服務供應商合作，擴大銷售管道和獲取更多運算資源。同時，微軟則希望在OpenAI達到「人工通用智慧」後仍能繼續存取其技術。\n近幾個月來，OpenAI已採取行動減少依賴微軟雲端服務。這些發展預示，曾經輝煌的AI合作關係可能快要出現重要的轉捩點。\n（首圖來源：達志影像）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "AI warfare push makes Helsing one of Europe’s 5 most valuable tech firms",
    "content": "Munich-based defence tech startup Helsing has raised€600mn as geopolitical tensions trigger a flood of capital into AI warfare.\nThe large investment was led by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s VC firm Prima Materia. Itbrings the company’s total raised to north of €1.3bn,building on a€450mn funding round in Julylast year.\nHelsing didn’t disclose its updated valuation. However, according to theFinancial Times, the unicorn company is now worth €12bn, making it one of Europe’s five most valuable private tech companies.\nPrima Materiawas one of Helsing’s earliest backers — a move that sparkedboycottsamong artists on Spotify, who feared their use of the platform was helping to fund war.That backlash clearly hasn’t deterred Ek, though, who said Helsing’s technology ensures “strategic autonomy” for Europe.\n“By doubling down on our investment, Prima Materia reaffirms its commitment to empowering Europe’s technological sovereignty — an ambition Helsing perfectly embodies,” said Ek.\nFounded in 2021, Helsing has developed an autonomous strike drone now in use by several European militaries, including Ukraine’s. The company also recently unveiled plans for a fleet of autonomousreconnaissance submarines, and last week successfully used its self-driving system to pilot a Saab fighter jet.\nHelsing is riding a defence investment boom as war in Ukraine and rising security concerns push European governments to double down on military spending and explore AI technologies for warfare.\nAccording to a new reportfrom McKinsey,investment in European defence techstartupsrose by over 500% between 2021 and 2024 compared to the previous three years.\nWhile Helsing is currently Europe’s most valuable defence tech startup, many other companies are experiencing rising demand for their technologies.\nIn May,Germandual-use drone makerQuantum Systems raised €160mn at a valuation north of €1bn, shortly after Portuguese drone startup Tekever also reached the coveted unicorn status.\nARX Robotics, another Munich-based company, recently raised €31mn to expand its fleet ofautonomous land drones, shortly after announcing itsplans to invest £45mn into anew UK factory.\nKate Leaman, chief market analyst at online broker AvaTrade,previously told TNWthat military tech companies have “huge potential” for growth — particularly those with AI-driven solutions.\n“We’re already seeing a shake-up in the defence sector, with AI-focused players like Palantir outperforming more traditional defence giants,” Leaman said. “This suggests that cutting-edge, tech-centric firms could possibly capture a sizeable share of the market.”\nSiôn is a freelance science and technology reporter, specialising in climate and energy.

    "title": "Facilitating Real-Time Transactions From Canada to the World: Zūm Rails Partners with Western Union",
    "content": "A recent survey conducted byInteracfound that nearly nine in 10 Canadians (88 per cent) have used Interac e-Transfer, a money-moving service inCanada. Canadians continue to rely on this product to move $338billion over the past 12 months, and over $625billion since the pandemic began, with 49 per cent indicating that they have increased their use in this period.\nHowever, moving money beyond Canada is challenging. This is where integrating Zūm Rails’ APIs into Western Union’s network is helpful. This will in turn enable the company to drive real-time movement of funds for Western Union customers using Interac eTransfer. With Interac eTransfer, customers can instantly fund their money transfers in Canada, then send the money to anywhere in the world.\nWith the rise of real-time payments and other digital experiences, consumers have become accustomed to sending and receiving money in seconds. However, speed is dictated by the payments rails technology integrated into a financial institution’s network. While new options have emerged to facilitate transactions in real-time, building the technology to integrate these rails and supporting compliance protocols into their existing infrastructures requires significant time and resources.\n“Our work with Western Union reflects a larger trend across the payments industry, defined by real-time money movement as a non-negotiable service for consumers and enterprises alike,” saidMiles Schwartz, CEO atZūm Rails.\n“Partnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintechs are proving to be a catalyst in accelerating this trend. Western Union is in a unique position to lead the industry forward, leveraging its technological innovation and its deep history in the cross-border remittance industry. We look forward to working with them to support their efforts in delivering an exceptional customer experience.”\n“Consumers should be able to send payments anywhere in the world at the same speed as they can with native peer-to-peer applications. Our work with Zūm Rails makes this a reality,” saidRanjit Sarai,vice president of digital and ecosystem at Western Union in Canada. “That is only part of what we have in store for Western Union customers as we work to bring a number of entirely new digital financial experiences to market, to complement the reliable service they’ve come to expect.”\nThe Fintech Times",

    "title": "Leading a Unicorn: In Conversation With Haider Khan, CEO of Bayut and dubizzle",
    "content": "Haider Khanis the CEO of proptech companyBayut, as well asdubizzle, an online marketplace. He is also the head of UAE-based unicornDubizzle Group MENA.\nAside from leading one of the region’s few unicorns, Khan also boasts an impressive list of experience, having spent a short time atGoldman Sachs, before spending the next 14 years atNational InstrumentsandSilicon Laboratories.\nDuring this time, he worked on a wide range of large-scale projects, from working on 5G technology to sharing his expertise with theElon Musk-led space technology companySpaceX.\nThe technology leader eventually moved on to the UAE in 2014, where he has successfully scaled high-growth platforms, raised over $500million in funding, and led a landmark merger withOLXacross the UAE, Pakistan, Egypt, and Lebanon. Under his leadership, Dubizzle Group became a company valued at over $1billion.\nWe sat down with Khan to find out more about how he led Dubizzle Group to success, his engineering background, progress in the UAE, and his big plans for the future.\nReaching unicorn status was never the end goal – it was a natural result of staying relentlessly focused on solving real consumer and business problems at scale. One of the most pivotal decisions we made early on was to double down on localisation. We didn’t just copy-paste global models – we reimagined them for the unique nuances of the UAE.\nSecondly, we embraced tech as a core differentiator, not just a support function. By investing heavily in our AI and ML capabilities at a very early stage, launching problem-solving products like TruCheck, and then scaling that with proprietary tools like TruBroker, TruEstimate and ProConnect, and maintaining a laser focus on user trust and quality, we created platforms that are not only large in reach but deep in value.\nOur acquisition strategy has also played a critical role, bringing dubizzle into the fold and building a full-stack ecosystem across classifieds and proptech gave us the kind of operational and data synergy that few players can match.\nIt starts with listening. Every market has its own economic rhythms, user behaviours and trust barriers—so while the technology stack might be scalable, the go-to-market execution must be hyperlocal.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our local teams drive product-market fit with autonomy, but within the framework of a centralised innovation roadmap. That means we stay true to our mission—building smarter ecosystems while giving our regional brands the freedom to innovate based on local feedback loops.\nOur unified vision acts as the North Star, but our strength lies in the adaptability of our routes to get there.\nMy engineering background taught me to break down complex problems and build solutions from the ground up. Whether it was working on 5G or at SpaceX, my mindset has always been the same: question everything, simplify where possible and focus on scalable outcomes that offer real value.\nThat approach has carried through into my work at Dubizzle Group. I always say this: I see technology as more than just a support tool. It’s a part of our DNA as an organisation, and it shapes how we solve problems for users, how we build trust and how we stay ahead.\nWe’ve embedded this thinking into everything, from building AI tools like TruEstimate to introducing authentication features like TruCheck or agent recognition systems like TruBroker. It’s about using smart tech to create better experiences, not just faster ones.\nOne of the biggest advantages of the UAE is the constant thirst for exceeding expectations, a sentiment that I deeply resonate with. The UAE isn’t just participating in digital transformation – it’s orchestrating it. What sets this region apart is its proactive policymaking and willingness to co-create with the private sector. Initiatives like the Dubai PropTech Hub and the Digital Economy Strategy reflect a bold vision to make this region a global tech powerhouse.\nFor tech companies, alignment means more than just regulatory compliance – it’s about impact. We need to build with purpose: empowering SMEs, upskilling talent, and embedding sustainability and inclusion into our platforms.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our investments in AI, local talent, and ecosystem data transparency are all aligned with the UAE’s ambition to be not just digitally enabled, but digitally sovereign.\nThe next phase is about moving from platforms to ecosystems. We’re connecting the dots between discovery, transaction, and post-sale services to create seamless, trust-driven digital journeys, whether someone is buying a car, renting a home, or launching a business.\nAIis a big part of that future. Our ‘Sell with AI’ tool already allows users to list with intelligent suggestions in seconds. In under a month, we have had over 100,000 listings added to the platform with this smart assistant. Bayut’s industry-leading solutions, like TruBroker and TruEstimate are helping bring unmatched transparency and efficiency to previously fragmented markets.\nWe’re also doubling down on our data infrastructure, predictive analytics, user insights, market benchmarks – so that every stakeholder, from agents to government bodies, can make faster, smarter decisions.\nUltimately, future-proofing means staying restless. We’re building for where the market is going, not just where it is today.\nThe Fintech Times",

    "content": "Published in its2025 Great Britain Shopper Survey,Curinosuncovers that digital expectations, competitive switching offers and generational shifts in behaviour are reshaping loyalty in the retail banking landscape.\nKurt Vogt Gwerder, strategy consultant at Curinos, said:“The 2025 GB Shopper Surveyshows traditional banks still lead in customer acquisition. However, digital challengers are gaining influence. Customers are no longer staying with banks out of habit – they’re switching for value.\n“Cash incentives still attract, but don’t guarantee satisfaction or loyalty. Digital challengers are building trust through better digital experiences and more relevant offerings, such as financial guidance. Promotions may draw people in, but only strong, engaging value propositions will keep them.”\nWhile the UK’s Big Seven banking providers remain the first stop for ‘new-to-banking’ customers (72 per cent), digital banks are making significant gains with more seasoned customers. In fact, 34 per cent of customers leaving a Big Seven bank switched to a digital challenger.\nNotably, 75 per cent of these switchers were moving for the first time since 2020, significantly above the market average of 62 per cent, highlighting a behavioural shift among long-term customers.\nAmong those switching from a Big Seven bank to a digital one, the top drivers of attrition were competitive offers (22 per cent) and dislike of their previous bank’s mobile app (18 per cent) and online banking (18 per cent).\nDigital banksnow acquire 59 per cent of their primary customers from switchers coming directly from the Big Seven. Despite this growing competition, the Big Seven banks continue to dominate, securing 61 per cent of primary current account openings over the past three years.\nThe majority of customers continue to prefer opening their account digitally (84 per cent), with smartphones (61 per cent) being the most preferred channel versus on a desktop (18 per cent) or via a tablet (five per cent).\nHowever, on average, 10 per cent of all recent account openers still prefer to set up their current account in person, with Boomers the generation most likely to prefer this option (23 per cent). Thirteen per cent of those new to banking are more likely to visit a branch to open an account, whilst 15 per cent of newcomers to the country are likely to do so.
