To work on a team led byformer Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wangand at a desk physically near Zuckerberg, Meta has reportedly offered employees from OpenAI and Google DeepMindcompensation packages worth upwards of $100 million.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirmed those reports on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman, which waspublished on Tuesday.However, the OpenAI CEO noted that Zuckerberg’s recruiting efforts have been largely unsuccessful and made sure to throw a few more digs at Meta in the process.\nNew episode of Uncapped with@sama. Enjoy 🤗pic.twitter.com/2IxYt3B4Gm\n“[Meta has] started making these, like, giant offers to a lot of people on our team,” Sam Altman said on the podcast. “You know, like, $100 million signing bonuses, more than that [in] compensation per year […] I’m really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take him up on that.”\nThe OpenAI CEO said he believed his employees made the assessment that OpenAI had a better chance of achieving AGI and may one day be the more valuable company. He also said he believes Meta’s focus on high compensation packages for employees, rather than the mission of delivering AGI, would likely not create a great culture.\nMeta reportedly tried topoachone of OpenAI’s lead researchers, Noam Brown, as well as Google’s AI architect, Koray Kavukcuoglu. However, both efforts were unsuccessful.\nSam Altman went on to say he believes OpenAI’s culture of innovation has been a major key to its success, and that Meta’s “current AI efforts have not worked as well as they hoped.” The OpenAI CEO said he respects many things about Meta but noted he doesn’t “think they’re a company that’s great at innovation.” Later in the podcast, Altman said he believes it’s not enough for companies to catch up on AI — they have to truly innovate to stay ahead.\nThe OpenAI CEO’s comments highlight some of the challenges that Meta has to overcome in order to build out a successful AI superintelligence lab. Besides bringing on Wang, Meta announced last week that itinvested significantlyin Wang’s former company, Scale AI. The company has also reportedlynabbed a few star AI researchers, such as Google DeepMind’s Jack Rae and Sesame AI’s Johan Schalkwyk. But there’s more work ahead.\nIn the coming year, Meta will have to staff up its new AI team while OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind operate at full speed. In the coming months, OpenAI is expected torelease an open AI modelthat’s likely to set Meta back in the AI race even further.\nLater on in the podcast, Sam Altman described an AI-powered social media feed that seems likely to encroach on Meta’s apps. The OpenAI CEO said he’s curious about exploring a social media app that uses AI to deliver custom feeds based on what users want, rather than the default, algorithmic feed that exists on traditional social media apps.\nOpenAI is reportedlyworking on a social networking appinternally. Meanwhile, Meta is experimenting with an AI-powered social network through its Meta AI app. However, it seems that some users are confused by the Meta AI app and have shared somehyperpersonal chats with the broader world.\nWhether AI-powered social networks take off remains to be seen. In the meantime, Zuckerberg and Sam Altman seem poised to butt heads over the AI talent race.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

It says, “Under this award, the performer will develop prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains.”\nWhether that reference to war-fighting applies to the weapons themselves or just other areas associated with wars, like paperwork, remains to be seen. OpenAI’s guidelines do forbid individual users to use ChatGPT or its APIs to develop or use weapons. However, OpenAI deleted the explicit prohibitions of “military and warfare” in its terms of service backin January 2024.\nGiven how heavily some powerful people in Silicon Valley have warned of the dangers of China’s advanced LLM models, it’s not surprising the DoD wants to use OpenAI for whatever purposes it wants. For instance, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, an OpenAI investor, recently appeared on Jack Altman’s “Uncapped” podcast (Jack is Sam Altman’s brother). Andreessen described the race between China’s AI andthe Western world’s models as a “cold war.”\nStill, perhaps an equally interesting part of this announcement is what it says about OpenAI’sincreasingly strained relationship with its major investor Microsoft.\nMicrosofthas thousands of contractswith the federal government worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It has, for decades, been implementing the strict security protocols necessary for the government — especially the DoD — to use its cloud.\nOpenAI announced this deal as part of its broader new “OpenAI for Government” program, which consolidates a number of other programs it uses to sell wares directly to government agencies, including the U.S. National Labs⁠, the Air Force Research Laboratory, NASA, NIH, and the Treasury, according to the company.\nBut it was only in April thatMicrosoft announcedthe DoD had approved its Azure OpenAI Service for all classified levels. Now the DoD is also going straight to the source.

The problem has reduced the visibility of users’ posts because many people on the platform have configured their settings to hide mature content by default.\nAccording to numerous posts from impacted Tumblr users, posts have been falsely flagged despite not being sexual or violent, and these false takedowns have included everything fromcat GIFs to fandom contenttoartand even apicture of hands. Some suspect that AI-based automation could be to blame for the issues.\nSimilar accusations have plagued other social media platforms in recent weeks. For instance, Pinterest finally admitted that an internal errorled to its mass user bans. Meanwhile, Instagram this week declined tocomment on its own trouble with mass bansthat users said have been given little coverage or attention outside of online complaints on apps like X and Reddit.\nIn both cases, users suspected that AI-based moderation was to blame, though Pinterest denied that was the case.\nOn Tumblr, the flagging issue is tied to an update to the Android app, where the company said it’s been experimenting with improvements to its mature content filtering systems. Specifically, it was testing out a new layer of moderation toContent Labels, the company told TechCrunch.\nA spokesperson for Tumblr said the experiments are continuing and, based on user feedback, will be improved before the changes roll out to other platforms.\n“As we work to make Tumblr a safer place for all users, we aim to respect a diverse set of interests and content preferences, which can be adjusted in settings. We view this as an ongoing process as we continue to fine-tune how we detect and address mature content,” a Tumblr spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company alsoacknowledged the problem on its blog, responding to a user’s question about the falsely flagged posts. Here, Tumblr’s team noted they were aware of the “incorrect classification issues” and were actively working to reduce them.\nIn addition, the post explained that Tumblr’s appeal process was being updated in the weeks ahead to be able to handle a higher volume of cases. (Tumblr did not respond to our questions about the appeals process’ planned changes.)\nWhether AI or other automation is to blame is not clear, as Tumblr wouldn’t speak specifically to the cause of the new issues. However, the reduced staffing at the blogging service has likely also played a role.\nFollowing its 2019acquisitionby WordPress.com maker Automattic,Tumblr has faced layoffsas its staff was reassigned toother projects at the parent company. Last year, Automattic announced that Tumblr’s back end would also bemoved to WordPressto make management easier and stemits financial losses.\nTopics\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated.\nApplied Intuition’s raise comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. The company makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions. That includes simulation software and managing data.\n“When they think like, ‘I have this software or AI problem,’ we generally want them to think about us,” CEO Qasar Younis told TechCrunch last year. “Like we want to be that first call.”\nApplied Intuition works with most of the major automakers, as well as autonomous vehicle companies such as Gatik and Kodiak.\nThe company has also increasingly pushed into the defense space. In its newsletter announcing the funding round, Applied Intuition shared that it was asked by the U.S. Army to help bringautonomous tech to some of its vehicles. The company was able to take an infantry squad vehicle from “bare bones” to autonomous in just 10 days. This included developing a “pedal-pushing robot to physically turn the wheel and press the throttle and brake pads.”\nCorrection: This article was updated to include that Applied Intuition closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer.

Anysphere also says Cursor users on the Ultra plan will get priority access to new features.\nAnysphere CEO Michael Truell said in the blog that the Ultra plan was made possible through multi-year partnerships with AI model providers. In the last several months, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have similarly rolled out pricier subscription plans — ranging from$100 a monthto$250 a month— as part of an effort to capitalize on their power users and offer them increased usage.\nThe new, pricy Cursor subscription plan seems poised to add revenue to Anysphere’s already booming business. Earlier this month, Anysphere announced that Cursor hadreached $500 million in annualized recurring revenueand is being used by major companies such as Nvidia, Uber, and Adobe.\nAnysphere was one of the fastest companies ever to reach $100 million in ARR, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Based onTechCrunch’s previous reporting, Cursor’s ARR has grown by $200 million since April.\nHowever, the race to develop “vibe-coding” tools is heating up, and many of the AI model providers Cursor relies on are developing their own AI coding products. OpenAI has reportedlyacquired Cursor’s competitor, Windsurf, to beef up its offerings of AI coding products. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to develop Claude Code, its in-house AI coding tool that utilizes its popular AI models.\nIt’s unclear whether Anysphere can sustain this level of growth without bumping into AI model providers. We’ve seen more competitive tactics emerge in the AI coding space as these businesses have grown. For example, Anthropic recentlyslashed Windsurf’s direct access to Claude AI modelsas a means to undercut its largest competitor, OpenAI.\nAt the same time, Anysphere has started putting more resources toward developing its own AI models that work alongside models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In May, Anysphere rolled out anew “Tab” AI model, which can suggest code changes across various files.\nIn a recent interview with TechCrunch, Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan said he believed Anthropic would be working with Cursor for a long time. Anysphere’s multi-year partnerships with Anthropic and other AI model providers certainly suggest these relationships aren’t going anywhere just yet. Nonetheless, the competition for users is getting more intense.\nTopics\nSenior AI Reporter\nFrom seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.

    "content": "On June 15, Luo Yonghao’s digital avatar hosted its first livestream on Baidu’s e-commerce platform, attracting more than 13 million views and generating over 55 million yuan ($7.66 million) in gross merchandise value. Several 3C and food product categories reportedly surpassed the sales figures from Luo’s real-person debut in May, marking a new high for AI-driven livestreams. The session featured several technical firsts for the industry. It was the first time a top-tier Chinese influencer was represented by an AI-generated avatar for an entire livestream, which lasted more than six hours. The stream also introduced multi-avatar interaction, with Luo’s avatar and a co-host engaging in synchronized gestures and banter, mimicking real human behavior. According to Baidu, the AI system drew from a 13,000-item knowledge base and generated 97,000 words of product descriptions, coordinating more than 8,300 avatar movements during the session. Luo, founder of Smartisan Technology and Thin Red Line, began livestreaming sales on Douyin to pay off his debts. He continued until 2022, when he announced his exit from all social media to focus on Thin Red Line. [Technode report]",

    "content": "Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai has revealed that the company’s engineers worked through the Chinese New Year holiday to accelerate AI development after the company felt pressured by DeepSeek’s breakthrough. Speaking at the VivaTech conference in Paris, Tsai said DeepSeek’s low-cost, high-performance AI model which launched in January shocked the industry and exposed Alibaba’s lag in the field. “We read the research papers and we said, ‘Holy cow, how come we have fallen behind? We were doing the same things,’” Tsai said. “What happened was our engineering lead decided and said, ‘Cancel your Chinese New Year holiday, everybody stay in the company, sleep in the office, we’re going to accelerate our development.’” Within weeks, Alibaba released its Qwen series models. The sudden, intense push from one of China’s biggest tech companies reflects the impact of DeepSeek’s development as well as Alibaba’s strategic pivot toward AI after a two-year restructuring focused on e-commerce and cloud computing. Tsai emphasized that making Qwen open source is aimed at popularizing AI use and boosting demand for cloud services. Alibaba plans to invest over $53 billion in AI infrastructure over three years and has partnered with Apple to provide AI technology for iPhones. Despite these efforts, Tsai acknowledged ongoing challenges, with Alibaba’s revenue growing just 7% in Q1 2024. [Bloomburg,SCMP]",

    "content": "隨著國中教育會考成績出爐，進入緊鑼密鼓的志願填寫階段。在台灣，無論是國中升高中，或高中升大學，考試依然是無法避免的重要關卡。隨著升學制度日趨多元，校系選擇豐富，考生與家長面臨的抉擇也越來越複雜。\n\n傳統的志願填寫多仰賴學校教師的經驗建議與家長的主觀判斷，難以全面評估每個學生的實際落點機率。如今隨著AI與大數據技術的應用逐步普及，結合歷年錄取資料與成績分布的落點分析系統，成為新一代考生的升學利器。\n傳統的落點分析，主要依賴前一年度的錄取分數、積分區間和歷年錄取趨勢，依靠教師與輔導升學人員對歷屆錄取分數的經驗與觀察來推估志願順位，這樣的方式常常無法即時反映當年度考生的分數分布變化。僅根據靜態歷史數據，對於校系篩選標準、篩選倍率、招生政策等年度變動反應遲緩，導致預測結果不夠精準。特別是當升學環境變化快速、學生選擇多元化時，傳統方式容易出現「高分落榜」、「低分填高」等落點錯判情況。\nAI大數據落點分析系統的出現，為志願填寫帶來了前所未有的革新。首先，在資料整合方面，AI系統能即時蒐集並比對當年度所有考生成績、志願填寫行為與歷年錄取資料，並且根據變動資料動態的修正其預測模型。\n其次，這些系統運用多重演算法，不僅依據多年累積的數據分析趨勢，更能即時納入當年使用者的實際填寫行為。透過模型判斷哪些校系可能被高估或低估，並據此提供個人化的志願建議，有效降低落榜風險，提升錄取的機會。\n在個人化層面，AI系統的演進能針對考生的成績進行比對，更進一步分析其學習歷程、核心能力與興趣偏好，有些系統甚至納入職涯相關指標，例如未來就業領域與期望薪資，協助考生找到與自身優勢和校系需求最契合的選擇。這類系統通常也具備即時回饋與追蹤功能。\n考生可以主動設定追蹤感興趣的校系，系統則會持續更新該校系的申請熱度與預估錄取分數變動情況。這不僅讓志願填寫策略更具彈性，也能因應市場變動做出前瞻性的調整。這些系統不再只是「比分數」的工具，而是逐漸轉型為能夠提供即時數據整合、個人潛能分析與升學策略建議的智慧平台。\n依筆者過往經驗，即時資料整合將成為發展重點。透過與各考招單位、國高中職、輔導單位的資料串接，這些系統能快速反映招生名額變化、志願填寫趨勢與錄取標準更新，強化預測模型的準確度。這種「動態升級」的特性，對學生而言是一大助力，能幫助他們做出更即時、彈性的策略調整。AI在深度個人化與適性推薦方面的應用更令人期待。未來結合大型語言模型（LLMs）與學習歷程資料，不僅能協助學生理解自己的學習特質，還能針對性地提出校系建議，甚至搭配職涯發展藍圖。\n不過，隨著AI系統的影響力愈來愈大，我們也不能忽視公平性與倫理的問題。如何確保演算法不因資料偏誤導致資源傾斜？怎麼確保學生的個資安全？這些都是未來必須面對的挑戰。AI可以輔助決策，但不應取代人的價值判斷，這點值得教育單位與技術開發者共同關注。\nAI大數據落點分析系統正在重新定義「升學輔導」的方式。對學生來說，這是一個機會，也是一份責任——要學會運用數據做選擇，同時也保有對自我未來的主動思考。未來的志願填寫，不再只是「填哪裡能上」，而是「選擇一條最適合自己的路」。\n（首圖來源：shutterstock）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "title": "主導權之爭成導火線，OpenAI 與微軟六年合作關係陷入危機",
    "content": "《華爾街日報》報導，被譽為科技史上最成功合作的 OpenAI 與微軟關係正面臨前所未有的挑戰。近期雙方緊張局勢急劇升溫，核心爭議圍繞 OpenAI 轉型為營利性公司以及 Windsurf 收購案的智財權歸屬問題。\n知情人士透露，OpenAI高層近期考慮採取所謂「核選項」（nuclear option），公開指控微軟有反競爭行為，並尋求聯邦監管機構審查雙方合約是否違反反壟斷法。此舉可能徹底改變這段維持六年的合作關係。雖然雙方聯合聲明表示「會談仍在進行，對未來合作充滿信心」，但內部分歧顯然難以掩蓋。\nOpenAI以30億美元收購AI程式新創公司Windsurf的交易成為雙方矛盾的焦點。根據現有協議，微軟可存取OpenAI所有智財權，但OpenAI不願將Windsurf智財權交給微軟，因為這可能強化微軟自家的競爭產品GitHub Copilot。\n另一關鍵議題是OpenAI轉型為「公益公司」後的股權分配。微軟要求的股份比例遠超OpenAI願意給予的範圍。對OpenAI而言，這已是一場時間賽跑，若未能在年底前完成轉型，可能損失高達200億美元的融資。\n自2019年微軟首次投資10億美元以來，這段合作已讓雙方深度綁定。微軟擁有OpenAI軟體工具在Azure雲端平台的獨家銷售權和優先技術存取權，且本應是OpenAI唯一的運算資源供應商。然而，隨著雙方在聊天機器人和企業AI工具等領域轉為競爭對手，這種關係變得更加複雜。\n現在，OpenAI希望能與其他雲端服務供應商合作，擴大銷售管道和獲取更多運算資源。同時，微軟則希望在OpenAI達到「人工通用智慧」後仍能繼續存取其技術。\n近幾個月來，OpenAI已採取行動減少依賴微軟雲端服務。這些發展預示，曾經輝煌的AI合作關係可能快要出現重要的轉捩點。\n（首圖來源：達志影像）\n文章看完覺得有幫助，何不給我們一個鼓勵\n您的咖啡贊助將是讓我們持續走下去的動力\n從這裡可透過《Google 新聞》追蹤 TechNews\n科技新知，時時更新",

    "content": "Munich-based defence tech startup Helsing has raised€600mn as geopolitical tensions trigger a flood of capital into AI warfare.\nThe large investment was led by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s VC firm Prima Materia. Itbrings the company’s total raised to north of €1.3bn,building on a€450mn funding round in Julylast year.\nHelsing didn’t disclose its updated valuation. However, according to theFinancial Times, the unicorn company is now worth €12bn, making it one of Europe’s five most valuable private tech companies.\nPrima Materiawas one of Helsing’s earliest backers — a move that sparkedboycottsamong artists on Spotify, who feared their use of the platform was helping to fund war.That backlash clearly hasn’t deterred Ek, though, who said Helsing’s technology ensures “strategic autonomy” for Europe.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025? Less than one week to go!\nLast chance to join the get a ticket before we sold out!\n“By doubling down on our investment, Prima Materia reaffirms its commitment to empowering Europe’s technological sovereignty — an ambition Helsing perfectly embodies,” said Ek.\nFounded in 2021, Helsing has developed an autonomous strike drone now in use by several European militaries, including Ukraine’s. The company also recently unveiled plans for a fleet of autonomousreconnaissance submarines, and last week successfully used its self-driving system to pilot a Saab fighter jet.\nHelsing is riding a defence investment boom as war in Ukraine and rising security concerns push European governments to double down on military spending and explore AI technologies for warfare.\nAccording to a new reportfrom McKinsey,investment in European defence techstartupsrose by over 500% between 2021 and 2024 compared to the previous three years.\nWhile Helsing is currently Europe’s most valuable defence tech startup, many other companies are experiencing rising demand for their technologies.\nIn May,Germandual-use drone makerQuantum Systems raised €160mn at a valuation north of €1bn, shortly after Portuguese drone startup Tekever also reached the coveted unicorn status.\nARX Robotics, another Munich-based company, recently raised €31mn to expand its fleet ofautonomous land drones, shortly after announcing itsplans to invest £45mn into anew UK factory.\nKate Leaman, chief market analyst at online broker AvaTrade,previously told TNWthat military tech companies have “huge potential” for growth — particularly those with AI-driven solutions.\n“We’re already seeing a shake-up in the defence sector, with AI-focused players like Palantir outperforming more traditional defence giants,” Leaman said. “This suggests that cutting-edge, tech-centric firms could possibly capture a sizeable share of the market.”\nSiôn is a freelance science and technology reporter, specialising in climate and energy.

    "content": "Qubits, entanglement, superposition, trapped ions, Schrödinger’s cat. These termssoundstrange because the world of quantum mechanics — where things can exist in multiple states at once —isstrange.\nThankfully, a group of students from TU Delft are bringing these powerful sub-atomic phenomena to life atTNW Conferencethrough an exhibition of abstract artworks.\nTheir project, Emergence Delft, blends science and creativity into a mind-bending exploration of quantum reality. A centrepiece of the exhibition is Coexist — a mesmerising light installation that captures the elusive nature of quantum mechanics through colour, interaction, and design.\nAt its heart, Coexist tackles superposition, the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states at once. For instance, a qubit — thequantumversion of a classical bit — can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. But it doesn’t stay that way forever. The moment it’s observed, the qubit collapses into a single, definitive state — a phenomenon known as the act of measurement.\nInside Coexist, a glowing white light — which contains all visible colours — symbolises superposition. Around it, oversized polarisation filters are arranged like futuristic portholes. As visitors peer through and rotate these filters, different colours are revealed, depending on how the filters interact with the light waves. Just like in quantum mechanics, the act of looking changes what you perceive.\nThe 💜 of EU tech\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Supporters said they raised awareness about environmental issues, while detractors called it a classic case of greenwashing.\nAt last year’s TNW Conference, we were guided through the twists and turns by Ali Russell, then the managing director of Extreme E. In his talk, Russell laid out his vision for fighting climate change through high-octane racing. He pitched it as both a testing ground forEVinnovation and a global platform for environmental advocacy.\nAre you ready for TNW Conference 2025?

    "title": "Google Begins Testing AI-Powered Search Live On Android And iOS",
    "content": "Google has initiated testing ofSearch Live, a new AI-driven voice search feature, onAndroid and iOSdevices. Announced during the Google I/O event in late May, this experimental feature is part of a broader push to integrateconversational artificial intelligenceacross Google’s products. It complements the rollout ofGoogle AI Ultra, enhancements toGemini 2.5, and deeper integration withAndroid XR.\nSearch Live enables users to interact with Google’s search engine throughnatural voice conversations, transforming the traditional search experience into a more dynamic and hands-free interaction. The feature is currently being rolled out to alimited group of test users, who will see a new icon below the search bar — sound waves accompanied by a star, the same symbol used forGemini Live, signaling AI-enhanced functionality.\nUsers can also activate Search Live by clicking a circular icon next to the text input area ofAI Mode. At this stage, Search Live replaces theGoogle Lens shortcutthat previously allowed users to search using images from their gallery.\nGoogle Search Live enables natural voice-based AI searches (Image:9to5Google)\nTheuser interfacefor Search Live is minimalist and intuitive. It includes the Google “G” logo in the top left, a colorful curved sound wave in the center indicating active AI interaction, and control buttons formuting the microphone,transcribing the conversation, viewingadditional options, orexiting the tool. The interface adapts to the device’s theme, offering both light and dark modes.\nDespite being in its early stages, Search Live ismostly stable. However, some limitations exist. For instance, the transcription button currently redirects users to the AI Mode chat interface instead of displayingreal-time subtitles, andcamera features are not yet supported. On the plus side, users can choose fromfour different voice assistants—Cosmo, Neso, Terra, and Cassini—for a personalized experience.\nThere isno confirmed timelinefor a full public release, but Google is steadily refining the tool. Search Live allows users toask questions verbally, addcontextual follow-ups, and receiveinteractive, card-style search results, which can even be read aloud.\nTo try Search Live ahead of its wider release, users can enroll inSearch Labs, although early access is limited to those selected for the testing phase by Google.\nFiled inCellphones>Robots>Tablets.

    "title": "WhatsApp Now Allows Users Forwarding Media To Meta AI For Analysis",
    "content": "WhatsApp is introducing a new feature that allows users to forwardphotos, videos, and texttoMeta AI, the platform’s integrated chatbot, for content analysis. Initiallyreleasedthrough thebeta channel (version 2.25.18.8 for Android), the feature is also gradually rolling out to some stable users.\nWith this new capability, Meta AI can analyze forwarded content to providecontextual information, such as identifying thelocation where a photo was taken,describing images,cross-referencing data, and evenverifying the authenticity of viral videos. This function aims to enhance the chatbot’s utility, especially for users seeking quick insights about media content.\nAccording to WhatsApp, the feature has potentialanti-misinformation benefits. By enabling users to verify forwarded content using Meta AI, the tool could become avaluable asset in combating fake news and misinformation, particularly in viral media shared across chats.\nIn terms ofprivacy, Meta AI only accesses contentexplicitly shared by the user. All shared data isend-to-end encryptedduring transmission and isdeleted from cloud serversafter processing. This approach is designed to maintain user trust and uphold WhatsApp’s strong privacy standards.\nTo use the feature, users canselect a photo or video, tap thesharebutton, and check ifMeta AIappears as a sharing option. If it does, the content can be forwarded directly to the chatbot for analysis and feedback.\nThis enhancement follows another recent update to WhatsApp, which introducednew animationsfor sending media, further improving the overall user experience. Additionally, WhatsApp is also testing anew method to copy message content, indicating the company’s broader effort to refine user interactions and expand the app’s functionality.\nThese updates reflect Meta’s ongoing push to integrate AI-driven tools across its platforms, with WhatsApp now becoming a more intelligent and interactive messaging environment. As AI integration deepens, more features like this are likely to emerge, giving users enhanced ways to understand and manage shared content.\nFiled inCellphones>Robots.

    "title": "Microsoft Launches AI-Powered Bing Video Creator To Compete With Google’s Veo 3",
    "content": "Microsoft has announced the launch of theBing Video Creator, a new tool thatuses artificial intelligence to generate short videos from text prompts. This release is seen as a direct response toGoogle’s recent unveiling of Veo 3with Flow at the AI25 event. Integrated into the Bing app for Android and iOS, the feature ispowered by Microsoft’s Sora AIand allows users tocreate videos for free.\nTo use the tool, users simply need to open the Bing app, tap on the “All” tab, and select “Video Creator.” From there, they can describe the scene they want to generate, including elements like setting, motion, and visual details. Once submitted, the AI begins generating the video, and users are notified when it’s ready—allowing them to multitask within the app in the meantime.\nThe Bing Video Creator supports videos up to five seconds long in both 9:16 (vertical) and 16:9 (horizontal) formats. Users can generate up to three videos at a time and choose between Standard or Fast creation speeds. Microsoft provides 10 fast-generation credits as a demo, and additional fast creations can be unlocked using Microsoft Rewards points.\nCreative prompts such as “a small otter working as a chef in a busy Italian pizzeria” or “a knight in armor riding his horse through an autumn forest” demonstrate the tool’s flexibility in supporting a wide range of visual styles and imaginative ideas.\nAll generated videos are stored in the Bing Video Creator for up to 90 days, during which users can download them, share on social media, or send via email. Importantly, each video includes C2PA credentials, clearly identifying it as AI-generated content—an effort aimed at promoting transparency and curbing misinformation.\nWith this release, Microsoft expands its footprint in the AI-generated media space and positions itself in direct competition with Google’s offerings. The Bing Video Creator not only enhances the Bing ecosystem but also aims to make AI-assisted video creation more accessible through a user-friendly experience and incentive-based usage model.\nFiled inCellphones>Computers>Robots.

    "title": "GMail Introduces AI Summaries By Default On Android And iOS",
    "content": "Googlehas begun rolling outautomatic AI-generated email summaries in the GMail app for Android and iOS. This update representsa shift from Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, being an optional feature to becoming a standard tool for certain users. The aim is to provide a quicker overview of long or multi-reply conversations without requiring manual input.\nPreviously,AI-generated summaries had to be triggered manually. Now, they appear automatically at the top of selected emails. The Gemini assistant determines when a summary is relevant based on the structure and content of the conversation. Typically, summaries are generated for extended email threads or discussions with numerous responses. These summaries are presented as concise bullet points and update dynamically as new messages are added to the conversation.\nInitially, this feature is being made available toGoogle Workspace users,Google One subscribers with the AI Premium plan, andusers with Gemini Education add-ons. For now, it islimited to emails written in Englishandonly available on mobile devices.\nUsers who prefer not to use AI summaries can opt out, but doing so comes with a trade-off. Disabling this feature requires turning off Gmail’s “smart features” entirely. This action also disables useful functionalities such aspriority notifications,package tracking,smart reply, andwriting suggestions.\nThe summarization feature is powered bylarge language models (LLMs)—the same technology that underpins modern AI assistants and chatbots. These models analyze email content to generate summaries, and in turn, Google may use anonymized data from emails to improve its AI systems.\nBy introducing automatic AI summaries, Google signals a broader strategy to integrate generative AI into its core products. The update is part of an ongoing effort to enhance Gmail’s efficiency for users who manage high volumes of emails. However, there isno official timelinefor when this feature will become available forpersonal Gmail accountsor for theweb version of Gmail.\nFiled inCellphones.

    "title": "One In Four European Firms Ban Grok AI Chatbot Over Security Concerns",
    "content": "According to a new report by cybersecurity firmNetskope,25% of European organizations have banned Grok, the generative AI chatbot created by Elon Musk. The data indicatesa significant level of distrusttoward Grok compared to other AI tools currently in use across Europe.\nBy comparison,OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the most widely adopted AI application, is blocked by only9.8%of European firms, whileGoogle’s Geminiis restricted by9.2%. The discrepancy reflects growing scrutiny over how different AI platforms handlesecurity, privacy, and content moderation.\nGrok has recently come under fire forspreading misinformation, includingfalse narratives about a “white genocide” in South Africaandquestionable claims related to the Holocaust. These incidents have prompted many organizations toopt for alternatives perceived as more secure and reliable.\nNeil Thacker, Global Privacy and Data Protection Officer at Netskope, explained that the bans reflect increasing corporate awareness arounddata privacy, model transparency, anddata usage policies. Businesses are beginning to distinguish between AI apps based on how responsibly they handle user inputs and data training practices.\nThe report also shows that91% of European organizationsnow utilize cloud-based generative AI chatbots, indicating widespread adoption of AI technology. However,usage is selective: some tools face resistance due tolicensing, transparency, or privacy concerns.\nStable Diffusion, the image-generation AI developed by UK-based Stability AI, holds the title of the most blocked AI app in Europe, restricted by41% of organizations. It is frequently flagged due toprivacy risks or ambiguous licensing practices.\nGianpietro Cutolo, a cloud threat researcher at Netskope, noted that organizations are becoming more sophisticated in assessing thesecurity risks of specific AI platforms. This growing caution is particularly visible in the case of Grok, which, despite being branded by Musk as a “truth-seeking AI,” is losing credibility in the enterprise space.\nThe backlash against Grok comes amid broader reputational challenges for Musk, including a reported52% drop in Tesla’s sales in the EUlast month. Some analysts suggest that Musk’spolitical associationsand public persona may benegatively impacting trustin his AI products as well.\nFiled inRobots.

    "content": "A recent survey conducted byInteracfound that nearly nine in 10 Canadians (88 per cent) have used Interac e-Transfer, a money-moving service inCanada. Canadians continue to rely on this product to move $338billion over the past 12 months, and over $625billion since the pandemic began, with 49 per cent indicating that they have increased their use in this period.\nHowever, moving money beyond Canada is challenging. This is where integrating Zūm Rails’ APIs into Western Union’s network is helpful. This will in turn enable the company to drive real-time movement of funds for Western Union customers using Interac eTransfer. With Interac eTransfer, customers can instantly fund their money transfers in Canada, then send the money to anywhere in the world.\nWith the rise of real-time payments and other digital experiences, consumers have become accustomed to sending and receiving money in seconds. However, speed is dictated by the payments rails technology integrated into a financial institution’s network. While new options have emerged to facilitate transactions in real-time, building the technology to integrate these rails and supporting compliance protocols into their existing infrastructures requires significant time and resources.\n“Our work with Western Union reflects a larger trend across the payments industry, defined by real-time money movement as a non-negotiable service for consumers and enterprises alike,” saidMiles Schwartz, CEO atZūm Rails.\n“Partnerships between traditional financial institutions and fintechs are proving to be a catalyst in accelerating this trend. Western Union is in a unique position to lead the industry forward, leveraging its technological innovation and its deep history in the cross-border remittance industry. We look forward to working with them to support their efforts in delivering an exceptional customer experience.”\n“Consumers should be able to send payments anywhere in the world at the same speed as they can with native peer-to-peer applications. Our work with Zūm Rails makes this a reality,” saidRanjit Sarai,vice president of digital and ecosystem at Western Union in Canada. “That is only part of what we have in store for Western Union customers as we work to bring a number of entirely new digital financial experiences to market, to complement the reliable service they’ve come to expect.”\nThe Fintech Times",

    "content": "Haider Khanis the CEO of proptech companyBayut, as well asdubizzle, an online marketplace. He is also the head of UAE-based unicornDubizzle Group MENA.\nAside from leading one of the region’s few unicorns, Khan also boasts an impressive list of experience, having spent a short time atGoldman Sachs, before spending the next 14 years atNational InstrumentsandSilicon Laboratories.\nDuring this time, he worked on a wide range of large-scale projects, from working on 5G technology to sharing his expertise with theElon Musk-led space technology companySpaceX.\nThe technology leader eventually moved on to the UAE in 2014, where he has successfully scaled high-growth platforms, raised over $500million in funding, and led a landmark merger withOLXacross the UAE, Pakistan, Egypt, and Lebanon. Under his leadership, Dubizzle Group became a company valued at over $1billion.\nWe sat down with Khan to find out more about how he led Dubizzle Group to success, his engineering background, progress in the UAE, and his big plans for the future.\nReaching unicorn status was never the end goal – it was a natural result of staying relentlessly focused on solving real consumer and business problems at scale. One of the most pivotal decisions we made early on was to double down on localisation. We didn’t just copy-paste global models – we reimagined them for the unique nuances of the UAE.\nSecondly, we embraced tech as a core differentiator, not just a support function. By investing heavily in our AI and ML capabilities at a very early stage, launching problem-solving products like TruCheck, and then scaling that with proprietary tools like TruBroker, TruEstimate and ProConnect, and maintaining a laser focus on user trust and quality, we created platforms that are not only large in reach but deep in value.\nOur acquisition strategy has also played a critical role, bringing dubizzle into the fold and building a full-stack ecosystem across classifieds and proptech gave us the kind of operational and data synergy that few players can match.\nIt starts with listening. Every market has its own economic rhythms, user behaviours and trust barriers—so while the technology stack might be scalable, the go-to-market execution must be hyperlocal.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our local teams drive product-market fit with autonomy, but within the framework of a centralised innovation roadmap. That means we stay true to our mission—building smarter ecosystems while giving our regional brands the freedom to innovate based on local feedback loops.\nOur unified vision acts as the North Star, but our strength lies in the adaptability of our routes to get there.\nMy engineering background taught me to break down complex problems and build solutions from the ground up. Whether it was working on 5G or at SpaceX, my mindset has always been the same: question everything, simplify where possible and focus on scalable outcomes that offer real value.\nThat approach has carried through into my work at Dubizzle Group. I always say this: I see technology as more than just a support tool. It’s a part of our DNA as an organisation, and it shapes how we solve problems for users, how we build trust and how we stay ahead.\nWe’ve embedded this thinking into everything, from building AI tools like TruEstimate to introducing authentication features like TruCheck or agent recognition systems like TruBroker. It’s about using smart tech to create better experiences, not just faster ones.\nOne of the biggest advantages of the UAE is the constant thirst for exceeding expectations, a sentiment that I deeply resonate with. The UAE isn’t just participating in digital transformation – it’s orchestrating it. What sets this region apart is its proactive policymaking and willingness to co-create with the private sector. Initiatives like the Dubai PropTech Hub and the Digital Economy Strategy reflect a bold vision to make this region a global tech powerhouse.\nFor tech companies, alignment means more than just regulatory compliance – it’s about impact. We need to build with purpose: empowering SMEs, upskilling talent, and embedding sustainability and inclusion into our platforms.\nAt Dubizzle Group, our investments in AI, local talent, and ecosystem data transparency are all aligned with the UAE’s ambition to be not just digitally enabled, but digitally sovereign.\nThe next phase is about moving from platforms to ecosystems. We’re connecting the dots between discovery, transaction, and post-sale services to create seamless, trust-driven digital journeys, whether someone is buying a car, renting a home, or launching a business.\nAIis a big part of that future. Our ‘Sell with AI’ tool already allows users to list with intelligent suggestions in seconds. In under a month, we have had over 100,000 listings added to the platform with this smart assistant. Bayut’s industry-leading solutions, like TruBroker and TruEstimate are helping bring unmatched transparency and efficiency to previously fragmented markets.\nWe’re also doubling down on our data infrastructure, predictive analytics, user insights, market benchmarks – so that every stakeholder, from agents to government bodies, can make faster, smarter decisions.\nUltimately, future-proofing means staying restless. We’re building for where the market is going, not just where it is today.\nThe Fintech Times",

    "content": "Published in its2025 Great Britain Shopper Survey,Curinosuncovers that digital expectations, competitive switching offers and generational shifts in behaviour are reshaping loyalty in the retail banking landscape.\nKurt Vogt Gwerder, strategy consultant at Curinos, said:“The 2025 GB Shopper Surveyshows traditional banks still lead in customer acquisition. However, digital challengers are gaining influence. Customers are no longer staying with banks out of habit – they’re switching for value.\n“Cash incentives still attract, but don’t guarantee satisfaction or loyalty. Digital challengers are building trust through better digital experiences and more relevant offerings, such as financial guidance. Promotions may draw people in, but only strong, engaging value propositions will keep them.”\nWhile the UK’s Big Seven banking providers remain the first stop for ‘new-to-banking’ customers (72 per cent), digital banks are making significant gains with more seasoned customers. In fact, 34 per cent of customers leaving a Big Seven bank switched to a digital challenger.\nNotably, 75 per cent of these switchers were moving for the first time since 2020, significantly above the market average of 62 per cent, highlighting a behavioural shift among long-term customers.\nAmong those switching from a Big Seven bank to a digital one, the top drivers of attrition were competitive offers (22 per cent) and dislike of their previous bank’s mobile app (18 per cent) and online banking (18 per cent).\nDigital banksnow acquire 59 per cent of their primary customers from switchers coming directly from the Big Seven. Despite this growing competition, the Big Seven banks continue to dominate, securing 61 per cent of primary current account openings over the past three years.\nThe majority of customers continue to prefer opening their account digitally (84 per cent), with smartphones (61 per cent) being the most preferred channel versus on a desktop (18 per cent) or via a tablet (five per cent).\nHowever, on average, 10 per cent of all recent account openers still prefer to set up their current account in person, with Boomers the generation most likely to prefer this option (23 per cent). Thirteen per cent of those new to banking are more likely to visit a branch to open an account, whilst 15 per cent of newcomers to the country are likely to do so. This demonstrates genuine demand for the service, suggesting branches remain a vital channel, particularly for interactions perceived as complex or stressful.\nFurthermore, the survey found that:\nThe Fintech Times",

    "title": "The Future of B2B Payments: Will Blockchain Finally Solve Cross-Border Payment Inefficiencies?",
    "content": "Cross-border transactions are costing companies over $120 billion per year in transaction fees, a report by Oliver Wyman and J.P. Morgan found. In spite of great fintech advances, conventional payment systems are still inefficient.\nAlthough originally designed as a platform to support decentralized cryptocurrencies, blockchain is emerging as a dynamic tool that can be used to greatly improve B2B cross-border payments.\nIt can significantly reduce transaction costs and dependency on intermediary banks, as well as increase speed and security by promoting direct peer-to-peer transactions on a protected distributed ledger.\nWithin B2B cross-border payments, blockchain can act as a decentralized payment rail. With automated compliance checks through the use of smart contracts and custom transaction tracking, it can enable businesses to perform transfers directly across borders in minutes.\nAs blockchain-based payment systems become adopted by fintech companies, the industry is currently at a turning point. Will regulation complexities and slower integration stand in the way of blockchain truly reshaping the future ofB2Bpayments?\nGlobalB2B paymentsare still processed through an older, dated infrastructure despite improvements within fintech. Some significant problems hindering this include:\nMost companies are researching B2B payment solutions to streamline costs and speed up transactions. International remittance complexities typically affect many intermediary banks, each charging its own processing fees.\nForeign exchange (FX) markups by banks and financial institutions also add additional fees to transactions.\nKey cost factors include:\nCross-border B2B payments are settled for an average of two to five business days, usually due to time zones, bank holidays, and manual authentication procedures. TheSWIFTnetwork, utilized by over 11,000 institutions, has several steps, each with failure points and delays.\nThis inefficiency creates cash flow issues and increases counterparty risks for international companies. The rising cost of cross-border transactions has generated a need for alternative payment methods, such as stablecoins and blockchain settlements.Lack of Transparency\nMany standard B2B payments are based on unseen banking processes without real-time tracking. Consumer payments benefit from innovations like real-time payment networks, but cross-border business transactions still rely on traditional systems. Consequently, after initiating the payment, businesses hardly have any idea where the funds are at any point in time. The lack of transparency can lead to:\nWe're excited to announce the successful completion of a cross-chain Delivery versus Payment (DvP) transaction in collaboration with Kinexys by J.P. Morgan (@jpmorgan) and@OndoFinance.https://t.co/W2IC8NeO18This milestone marks the first-of-its-kind cross-chain, atomic…pic.twitter.com/0J1tA3AYWk\nCompliance Barriers\nThe limitations of anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), as well as counter-terrorist financing (CTF) can be quite restricting for cross-border B2B transactions. Regulations differ in each jurisdiction, and companies must go through a complex web of compliance requirements.\nSanctions violations must be screened through transactions by financial institutions, which is time-consuming. The ever-changing nature of the regulations means that companies must continually update compliance systems, and this naturally adds to the expense of administrative costs and operating expenses.\nBlockchain technology can combat these challenges within B2B payments by offering decentralized, transparent, andefficient payment systems. The biggest advantages of making use of blockchain-based B2B payments are:\nLowering Costs\nBlockchain eliminates the presence of intermediaries like correspondent banks, minimizing the cost of transactions in conventional payment systems. In contrast to SWIFT-based transfers where both parties are served a portion of the transaction fee, blockchain transactions take place over a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that minimizes cost significantly.\nFaster Settlement Times\nBlockchain payment technologies decrease cross-border payment delays from multiple days to just minutes, which unlike the multi-step payment processes of traditional payment systems, revolutionizes fintech cross-border innovation.\nThis is how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether)facilitate faster paymentsbetween companies. Ethereum and Solana networks have been shown to be able to sustain high-speed, large-scale transactions without bank authorization, making them perfect for B2B settlements.\nTransparency & Security\nBlockchain employs a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to store all the transactions in an open, fixed ledger. This degree of transparency thus enables businesses to see transactions in real-time, minimizing the scope for fraud and inefficiency in reconciliations. Compared to traditional banking infrastructure, where transaction histories might have been hidden due to banking regulations, blockchain provides an unerasable history of transactions.\nSmart Contracts\nBlockchain payment solutions can also facilitate compliance automation via smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded instructions to execute based on regulatory requirements.\nThe contracts can automate AML and KYC checks prior to a transaction,enhancing the regulatory complianceof blockchain payments. Some blockchain networks have incorporated compliance-friendly frameworks to make regulatory adoption easier.\nAI-Powered Fraud Detection\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in blockchain payments to provide greater anti-fraud capability and regulatory reporting. AI-powered systems can analyze transaction behavior in real time, detect suspicious behavior, and stop fraudulent payments from being sent.\nCyber crime Unit Hyderabad city as a part Cyber Jaagrookta Diwas conducted cyber awareness program about Parcel Scam&digital arrest, trading, APK files, Crypto currency, part time job& Investment, OTP, customer care, other social media trolling at State Bank of India Patny centrepic.twitter.com/AaS67Suloj\nAI improves payment automation through cash management optimization, predicting delays, and automating transactional flows reconciliation. AI and blockchain together offer greater security levels and business operational efficiency improvement in B2B payments.\nThe Rise of Stablecoins in B2B Transactions\nStablecoins, digital currencies pledged against money, are emerging as a solution of choice for effortless B2B payments. The world's biggest banks and fintech giants, such as Bank of America, Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe, are moving into a space long dominated by Tether and Circle.\nWith increasing regulatory support, stablecoins provide a quicker, cheaper alternative to traditional banking systems. Regulators now tackle concerns aboutstablecoin adoption, clearing the way for its inclusion in the global financial system.\nInstitutional Adoption\nFinancial institutions are realizing the potential of how blockchain technology can improve payment systems. The advances align with a trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing blockchain technology in business with the objective of improving efficiency, security, and transparency for B2B payments.\nNotable institutional blockchain initiatives include:\nCBDCs and the Future of Government-Issued Digital Currencies\nWorld central banks are looking into the implementation of digital forms of their domestic currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The digital currency will be a safe, low-cost, and efficient payment medium that can replace cash and upgrade the payment system. CBDCs could bypass intermediaries in payments to reduce expenses and enhance speed.\nBlockchain must be able to seamlessly integrate with standard financial systems for it to be applied successfully in mass within B2B payments. Projects like mBridge are a central bank initiative that aims to enable instant, peer-to-peer cross-border payments in the form of CBDCs.\nMeanwhile, solutions for seamless payments across different platforms are being designed by companies like Visa. For instance, cross-chain interoperability solutions which allows CBDCs to work with Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems. All these developments are leading us to wider blockchain adoption in traditional finance.\nAs B2B payments shift more toward blockchain, regulators are syncing the compliance frameworks. Whereas AML/KYC and CBDC regulations remain divided, efforts such as the Atlantic Council's digital asset policy roadmap are working towards creating international standards.\nPolicymakers are also seeking frameworks to bring CBDCs,stablecoins, and blockchain payments under a common legal framework. Regulatory sandboxes are empowering fintech companies to test blockchain solutions in pilot environments before implementing them on a full scale.\nSantander, one of the biggest banking groups in Europe, is using RippleNet to enable cross-border payments via its One Pay FX service. The blockchain technology enables Santander to settle payments in seconds, whereas the usual 3–5 business days for SWIFT-based payments are required.\nSantander launched a blockchain-based foreign exchange service that uses Ripple's technology.https://t.co/oPSPDuAP3Npic.twitter.com/YNTO3kt2k9\nThe bank has shown cost savings on cross-border remittances, proving the economic advantage of using blockchain.\nIBM's World Wire: A Cross-Border Payment Solution for Banks\nIBM’s World Wire uses the Stellar blockchain to enable cross-border payments between banks. The platform makes it possible for companies to pay in various digital assets, including stablecoins, offering a safe and regulatory-compliant payment method outside the traditional payment networks.\nWorld Wire has gone global, promoting financial inclusion and reducing global payment flows. Blockchain is revolutionizing B2B payments by offering reduced costs, quicker settlements, and improved transparency.\nCross-border transactions are costing companies over $120 billion per year in transaction fees, a report by Oliver Wyman and J.P. Morgan found. In spite of great fintech advances, conventional payment systems are still inefficient.\nAlthough originally designed as a platform to support decentralized cryptocurrencies, blockchain is emerging as a dynamic tool that can be used to greatly improve B2B cross-border payments.\nIt can significantly reduce transaction costs and dependency on intermediary banks, as well as increase speed and security by promoting direct peer-to-peer transactions on a protected distributed ledger.\nWithin B2B cross-border payments, blockchain can act as a decentralized payment rail. With automated compliance checks through the use of smart contracts and custom transaction tracking, it can enable businesses to perform transfers directly across borders in minutes.\nAs blockchain-based payment systems become adopted by fintech companies, the industry is currently at a turning point. Will regulation complexities and slower integration stand in the way of blockchain truly reshaping the future ofB2Bpayments?\nGlobalB2B paymentsare still processed through an older, dated infrastructure despite improvements within fintech. Some significant problems hindering this include:\nMost companies are researching B2B payment solutions to streamline costs and speed up transactions. International remittance complexities typically affect many intermediary banks, each charging its own processing fees.\nForeign exchange (FX) markups by banks and financial institutions also add additional fees to transactions.\nKey cost factors include:\nCross-border B2B payments are settled for an average of two to five business days, usually due to time zones, bank holidays, and manual authentication procedures. TheSWIFTnetwork, utilized by over 11,000 institutions, has several steps, each with failure points and delays.\nThis inefficiency creates cash flow issues and increases counterparty risks for international companies. The rising cost of cross-border transactions has generated a need for alternative payment methods, such as stablecoins and blockchain settlements.Lack of Transparency\nMany standard B2B payments are based on unseen banking processes without real-time tracking. Consumer payments benefit from innovations like real-time payment networks, but cross-border business transactions still rely on traditional systems. Consequently, after initiating the payment, businesses hardly have any idea where the funds are at any point in time. The lack of transparency can lead to:\nWe're excited to announce the successful completion of a cross-chain Delivery versus Payment (DvP) transaction in collaboration with Kinexys by J.P. Morgan (@jpmorgan) and@OndoFinance.https://t.co/W2IC8NeO18This milestone marks the first-of-its-kind cross-chain, atomic…pic.twitter.com/0J1tA3AYWk\nCompliance Barriers\nThe limitations of anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), as well as counter-terrorist financing (CTF) can be quite restricting for cross-border B2B transactions. Regulations differ in each jurisdiction, and companies must go through a complex web of compliance requirements.\nSanctions violations must be screened through transactions by financial institutions, which is time-consuming. The ever-changing nature of the regulations means that companies must continually update compliance systems, and this naturally adds to the expense of administrative costs and operating expenses.\nBlockchain technology can combat these challenges within B2B payments by offering decentralized, transparent, andefficient payment systems. The biggest advantages of making use of blockchain-based B2B payments are:\nLowering Costs\nBlockchain eliminates the presence of intermediaries like correspondent banks, minimizing the cost of transactions in conventional payment systems. In contrast to SWIFT-based transfers where both parties are served a portion of the transaction fee, blockchain transactions take place over a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that minimizes cost significantly.\nFaster Settlement Times\nBlockchain payment technologies decrease cross-border payment delays from multiple days to just minutes, which unlike the multi-step payment processes of traditional payment systems, revolutionizes fintech cross-border innovation.\nThis is how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether)facilitate faster paymentsbetween companies. Ethereum and Solana networks have been shown to be able to sustain high-speed, large-scale transactions without bank authorization, making them perfect for B2B settlements.\nTransparency & Security\nBlockchain employs a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to store all the transactions in an open, fixed ledger. This degree of transparency thus enables businesses to see transactions in real-time, minimizing the scope for fraud and inefficiency in reconciliations. Compared to traditional banking infrastructure, where transaction histories might have been hidden due to banking regulations, blockchain provides an unerasable history of transactions.\nSmart Contracts\nBlockchain payment solutions can also facilitate compliance automation via smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded instructions to execute based on regulatory requirements.\nThe contracts can automate AML and KYC checks prior to a transaction,enhancing the regulatory complianceof blockchain payments. Some blockchain networks have incorporated compliance-friendly frameworks to make regulatory adoption easier.\nAI-Powered Fraud Detection\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in blockchain payments to provide greater anti-fraud capability and regulatory reporting. AI-powered systems can analyze transaction behavior in real time, detect suspicious behavior, and stop fraudulent payments from being sent.\nCyber crime Unit Hyderabad city as a part Cyber Jaagrookta Diwas conducted cyber awareness program about Parcel Scam&digital arrest, trading, APK files, Crypto currency, part time job& Investment, OTP, customer care, other social media trolling at State Bank of India Patny centrepic.twitter.com/AaS67Suloj\nAI improves payment automation through cash management optimization, predicting delays, and automating transactional flows reconciliation. AI and blockchain together offer greater security levels and business operational efficiency improvement in B2B payments.\nThe Rise of Stablecoins in B2B Transactions\nStablecoins, digital currencies pledged against money, are emerging as a solution of choice for effortless B2B payments. The world's biggest banks and fintech giants, such as Bank of America, Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe, are moving into a space long dominated by Tether and Circle.\nWith increasing regulatory support, stablecoins provide a quicker, cheaper alternative to traditional banking systems. Regulators now tackle concerns aboutstablecoin adoption, clearing the way for its inclusion in the global financial system.\nInstitutional Adoption\nFinancial institutions are realizing the potential of how blockchain technology can improve payment systems. The advances align with a trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing blockchain technology in business with the objective of improving efficiency, security, and transparency for B2B payments.\nNotable institutional blockchain initiatives include:\nCBDCs and the Future of Government-Issued Digital Currencies\nWorld central banks are looking into the implementation of digital forms of their domestic currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The digital currency will be a safe, low-cost, and efficient payment medium that can replace cash and upgrade the payment system. CBDCs could bypass intermediaries in payments to reduce expenses and enhance speed.\nBlockchain must be able to seamlessly integrate with standard financial systems for it to be applied successfully in mass within B2B payments. Projects like mBridge are a central bank initiative that aims to enable instant, peer-to-peer cross-border payments in the form of CBDCs.\nMeanwhile, solutions for seamless payments across different platforms are being designed by companies like Visa. For instance, cross-chain interoperability solutions which allows CBDCs to work with Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems. All these developments are leading us to wider blockchain adoption in traditional finance.\nAs B2B payments shift more toward blockchain, regulators are syncing the compliance frameworks. Whereas AML/KYC and CBDC regulations remain divided, efforts such as the Atlantic Council's digital asset policy roadmap are working towards creating international standards.\nPolicymakers are also seeking frameworks to bring CBDCs,stablecoins, and blockchain payments under a common legal framework. Regulatory sandboxes are empowering fintech companies to test blockchain solutions in pilot environments before implementing them on a full scale.\nSantander, one of the biggest banking groups in Europe, is using RippleNet to enable cross-border payments via its One Pay FX service.

    "title": "Payments in 2025: A Simpler, Smarter, and Faster World—But Challenges Remain",
    "content": "The payments industry is going through one of its most transformative periods yet. In 2025, the focus is clear: make payments faster, more secure, and more integrated into people’s daily lives. Businesses and consumers alike are demanding smoother experiences, whether they’re shopping online, paying bills, sending money abroad, or managing subscriptions.\nAt the centre of this shift is technology. From real-time payment systems and digital wallets to AI-powered personalisation and biometric security, innovation is reshaping every part of the payment journey.\nLet's explore the top trends definingthe payments industry in 2025—from the rise of real-time global transactions and smart money management to the growing importance of digital identity and biometric security. These changes aren’t just shaping how money moves—they’re reshaping what customers expect from financial services.\nToday’s users want more than just a place to store money—they want tools that help them manage it better. Whether it’s tracking subscriptions, setting savings goals, or getting alerts on spending patterns, customers expect intuitive, in-app features that make daily money management easier. And if their provider doesn’t offer it, many are happy to switch.\nAccording to Visa and Tink, over 70% of consumers in Europe already use digital apps to manage their finances, and younger generations are leading the shift.\nThat’s why traditional banks and issuers are under pressure to deliver slick, mobile-first experiences—especially as neobanks and fintechs raise the bar with fast, flexible services.\nReal-time payments (RTP) are becoming standard in many domestic markets, but the next frontier is cross-border. Businesses and individuals want to send money abroad as easily as they do within their own country—quickly, clearly, and at low cost.\nBut there’s a gap between what users expect and what they get. Many cross-border payments still take days, carry high fees, and lack transparency.Visaresearch found that 67% of marketplace sellers say slow payouts hurt their ability to do business. And only 2.3% of small businesses are satisfied with their current cross-border options.\nEfforts are underway to fix this. Global RTP initiatives, digital wallet innovation, andsolutions like Visa Direct aim to make cross-border transfers real-time, transparent, and seamless. But the complexity of managing different regulations, currencies, and networks still poses major hurdles.\nAI is transforming how payments are processed and secured. It’s helping businesses spot fraud faster, tailor financial tools to users, and automate customer service. Expect to see moreAI-powered personalisation in the coming years, from spending advice to predictive budgeting suggestions.\nAt the same time, digital identity tools—like facial recognition and fingerprint scans—are replacing old-school passwords. These biometric tools offer more convenience and stronger security, making it easier for users to confirm payments with a simple touch or glance.\nThe rise of subscription services has changed how people spend, but also introduced new pain points—like forgotten renewals or hidden charges. Half of UK consumers want banks to help manage their subscriptions, with tools to flag recurring charges and cancel unwanted payments.\nBy adding these features, banks and payment providers can boost engagement and show they care about users’ actual financial needs, not just transactions.\nMore payment experiences are now built directly into apps and platforms. Whether it’s paying in a ride-sharing app or getting a loan during checkout, embedded finance is becoming part of everyday commerce. At the same time, Account-to-Account (A2A) payments are gaining ground, offering a direct, cost-effective way to move money without using cards.\nBut with new channels come new risks. Fraud is growing in RTP and A2A networks, and providers must invest in real-time protection tools to stay ahead.\nThe payments space in 2025 is full of opportunity—but not without pressure. Consumers want faster, easier, and more secure services. Businesses want efficiency and reach. And regulators want safety and compliance.\nTo succeed, payment providers need to offer more than just transactions. They must become trusted partners that help users understand, manage, and move their money with confidence. That means using smart technology, fixing cross-border pain points, and building tools that put users in control.\nIn a world where payments are expected to be as easy as sending a message, anything less simply won’t do.\nThe payments industry is going through one of its most transformative periods yet.

And if their provider doesn’t offer it, many are happy to switch.\nAccording to Visa and Tink, over 70% of consumers in Europe already use digital apps to manage their finances, and younger generations are leading the shift.\nThat’s why traditional banks and issuers are under pressure to deliver slick, mobile-first experiences—especially as neobanks and fintechs raise the bar with fast, flexible services.\nReal-time payments (RTP) are becoming standard in many domestic markets, but the next frontier is cross-border. Businesses and individuals want to send money abroad as easily as they do within their own country—quickly, clearly, and at low cost.\nBut there’s a gap between what users expect and what they get. Many cross-border payments still take days, carry high fees, and lack transparency.Visaresearch found that 67% of marketplace sellers say slow payouts hurt their ability to do business. And only 2.3% of small businesses are satisfied with their current cross-border options.\nEfforts are underway to fix this. Global RTP initiatives, digital wallet innovation, andsolutions like Visa Direct aim to make cross-border transfers real-time, transparent, and seamless. But the complexity of managing different regulations, currencies, and networks still poses major hurdles.\nAI is transforming how payments are processed and secured. It’s helping businesses spot fraud faster, tailor financial tools to users, and automate customer service. Expect to see moreAI-powered personalisation in the coming years, from spending advice to predictive budgeting suggestions.\nAt the same time, digital identity tools—like facial recognition and fingerprint scans—are replacing old-school passwords. These biometric tools offer more convenience and stronger security, making it easier for users to confirm payments with a simple touch or glance.\nThe rise of subscription services has changed how people spend, but also introduced new pain points—like forgotten renewals or hidden charges. Half of UK consumers want banks to help manage their subscriptions, with tools to flag recurring charges and cancel unwanted payments.\nBy adding these features, banks and payment providers can boost engagement and show they care about users’ actual financial needs, not just transactions.\nMore payment experiences are now built directly into apps and platforms. Whether it’s paying in a ride-sharing app or getting a loan during checkout, embedded finance is becoming part of everyday commerce. At the same time, Account-to-Account (A2A) payments are gaining ground, offering a direct, cost-effective way to move money without using cards.\nBut with new channels come new risks. Fraud is growing in RTP and A2A networks, and providers must invest in real-time protection tools to stay ahead.\nThe payments space in 2025 is full of opportunity—but not without pressure. Consumers want faster, easier, and more secure services. Businesses want efficiency and reach. And regulators want safety and compliance.\nTo succeed, payment providers need to offer more than just transactions. They must become trusted partners that help users understand, manage, and move their money with confidence. That means using smart technology, fixing cross-border pain points, and building tools that put users in control.\nIn a world where payments are expected to be as easy as sending a message, anything less simply won’t do.",

    "title": "How SS&amp;C Intralinks is driving growth in Asia with AI-powered M&amp;A and seamless alternative investment fund management",
    "content": "Despite rising trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty around US policy, M&A and financing professionals remain optimistic about dealmaking in APAC. This confidence reflects the upbeat sentiment at the start of the year where 94% of respondents in the SS&C Intralinks ‘2025 APAC M&A Dealmakers Sentiment Report,’ produced with Reuters, anticipated increased deal activity, with nearly half predicting significant growth.\n“This tells us there was confidence and a renewed appetite for growth,” said Alex Turner, Vice President, Sales - Asia Pacific, at SS&C Intralinks. While the report was published before the latest bout of volatility, growth in early-stage M&A and fundraising activity continues. “Dealmakers are preparing to launch projects once the market settles.”\nTurner’s view reflects conducive conditions for deals – from more stable interest rates in key markets, to growth in China+1 supply-chain strategies, to plans to put dry powder to work. “As a result, we expect there will be a shift from middle-market deals to larger, high-value deals this year,” explained Turner.\nAt the same time, deal financing remains a key challenge, he added. “Over half of the dealmakers we surveyed expect financing conditions to become more difficult over the next year, with 28% identifying it as the most challenging aspect of dealmaking.”\nThis is no surprise. Today’s high-pressure environment may be more intense than ever, with economic volatility, geopolitical tensions and fragmented regulations compounding already tight deal timelines. Adding to the challenge is the exponential growth of the volume of data involved in due diligence — leaving little room for inefficiency.\nA more intelligent approach to doing deals\nSS&C Intralinks has spent years developing proprietary AI models and technologies to bring powerful, deal-ready innovation to its clients. In today’s environment, AI-driven insights are no longer optional — they’re essential to getting deals get done so firms can begin driving value from day one.\n“Those who can move quickly while making informed choices and demonstrating control over their data and workflows gain a real competitive edge,” explained Turner.\nThe ability to efficiently ingest, analyse and act on an overwhelming volume of information through automation can help to alleviate many bottlenecks that have traditionally slowed down transactions, he added. “Whether it’s consolidating and analysing massive volumes of due diligence data, streamlining investor communication, or maintaining full visibility across complex deal structures, smarter workflows are enabling teams to work faster and more confidently across borders and stakeholder groups.”\nUsing AI is becoming essential to meet evolving expectations from investors, advisors and regulators in terms of real-time reporting and auditable transparency. In fact, 98% of respondents in the survey said they expect AI-powered tools in M&A and financing to increase in the coming year.\nYet with adoption in its early stages, the goal is to find the right partners and solutions that offer robust AI features plus align with the regulatory and security requirements of a specific industry.\n“This is one of the key reasons the next generation of the SS&C Intralinks platform has been built to fully integrate AI into the tools, analytics and workflows used by dealmakers in DealCentre AI™,” said Turner.\nFinding new ways to fuel fundraising\nSpeed and transparency have become increasingly key success factors for fundraising, too.\nAccording to Turner, a mindset shift among fund managers has led to an increasing focus on managing the entire experience for limited partners (LPs) and other investors end-to-end, from fundraising to onboarding to reporting.\n“As fundraising cycles lengthen and investor attention becomes more fragmented, general partners (GPs) need to offer a more personalised and intuitive investor experience that builds trust throughout the entire fundraising cycle,” he added.\nUltimately, the fund managers that will thrive in this environment are the ones that treat fundraising as more of a dynamic and data-informed process that moves with the investor and the market.\nThis will therefore meet the increasingly selective approach LPs are taking when it comes to the quality, transparency and timeliness of information they receive. “It’s that level of visibility that gives them the confidence to commit capital,” Turner added.\nLiving up to changing expectations\nAs AI becomes more embedded in dealmaking and fundraising, technology needs to feel intuitive and purposeful. Achieving this will close the gap between what Turner calls “the promise of AI and the day-to-day reality for most teams”.\nThis is the foundation of thoughtful guidance and partnership, aimed at achieving key goals such as:\nUnderpinning the solutions, however, is a commitment to service, said Turner. “Technology is essential, but one of our most valuable differentiators is the depth of our industry expertise. Having supported trillions in transactions, our experience shapes every decision we make — and that’s what keeps us at the forefront of innovation in dealmaking.”\nClick here for more details onSS&C Intralinks,DealCentre AIandFundCentre™\nReference sources",
